# Drill library for climbing performance across four goals





### Limit boulder sets

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by competition time–motion and strength/power determinants). 

**Purpose (targets):** Maximal bouldering strength/power and problem-solving under near-limit intensity. Best for Goal: **bouldering**; also supports “crux” intensity for hard sport routes.

**Mechanism:** High-intensity attempts bias neural recruitment and intermuscular coordination; long rest preserves output so the limiting factor is strength/power rather than metabolic fatigue. The relevance matches bouldering attempt structure (short bursts with rest). 

**Execution (session template):**
- **Setup:** Choose 3–6 problems or sequences at/above current limit (you should fail within 1–4 moves when fresh, or require multiple high-quality attempts to link).
- **Work:** For each problem, take **3–6 attempts**. Each attempt should be ≤20–40 seconds of high output (stop if you start “thrashing”).
- **Rest:** **3–6+ minutes** between hard attempts (longer if power is dropping).
- **Intensity:** RPE **9–10** (max effort with good form).
- **Total volume target:** 12–25 “quality attempts” total, not counting warm-ups.

**Progressions:**
- Increase difficulty by hold size/angle/style, not by shortening rest.
- Progress attempt quality first: fewer “sloppy” attempts, more attempts that reach the same high point.

**Regressions:**
- Reduce steepness or hold intensity while keeping coordination demands.
- Use “limit moves” (single-move practice) instead of full problems.

**Coaching cues:**
- “One intention per attempt” (change one variable: beta, grip, timing).
- “Stop before form leaks” (power sessions are quality-limited).

**Safety considerations:**
- Avoid adding campus work on the same day early in a cycle; both are high stress for fingers/shoulders. Overuse risk management is central. citeturn13search0turn16view0

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–2 sessions/week, separated by 48–72 hours if combined with other high-intensity finger drills.

**Progress metrics:** Highest benchmark move linked; attempts-to-send; “quality attempts” completed; subjective output drop-off (e.g., power score 1–5).

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Limit boulder sets | Boulder harder / crux strength | 3–6 limit problems; 3–6 attempts each; 3–6+ min rest | Attempts-to-send; highest move linked | Coach-practice |

### Max hangs on hangboard

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (protocol parameters described and widely used in research/practice). citeturn20view0turn8search0

**Purpose (targets):** Max finger force (contact strength ceiling). Best for Goal: **bouldering**, supports all rope goals by lowering relative intensity of holds.

**Mechanism:** Heavy isometric loading increases maximal force capacity via neural and muscular adaptations; higher max reduces %MVC used on holds, plausibly improving endurance downstream. 

**Execution (classic protocol):**
- **Setup:** 18–22 mm edge (or 20 mm); consistent grip (often half crimp). Add weight or use assistance to hit target. Use a timer and strict scapular set.
- **Warm-up:** progressive easy hangs and easy climbing first.
- **Work:** **6 × 10 s** hangs at **85–95% of 1RM**.
- **Rest:** **2 minutes** between 10 s efforts.
- **Intensity:** RPE **9–10**, but the final reps should be near-max while still *clean*.
- **Stop rule:** terminate session if pain is sharp or if form degrades (shoulders rising, elbow bend changing, uncontrolled swing).

This dosing is explicitly described as the Max Hangs protocol in a large-scale retrospective evaluation of hangboard programs (using a standardized definition). 

**Progressions:**
- Increase load 1–2% when all 6 reps are clean across two sessions.
- Alternatively, keep load and reduce edge depth only after several weeks (more aggressive).

**Regressions:**
- Use foot assistance to maintain intensity with less absolute finger stress.
- Use fewer reps (e.g., 4 × 10 s) during weeks with heavy climbing.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Set the shoulder blades; hang tall.”
- “No jerking into the hang; ease into tension over ~1 second.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Avoid max hangs when skin is split or when finger pain persists next morning; injury reviews emphasize careful load management for overuse. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–2×/week (often 1× when climbing volume is high).

**Progress metrics:** Total load held (BW + added − assistance); strength-to-weight ratio; perceived grip quality.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Max hangs | Boulder harder; supports all | 6×10 s @ 85–95% 1RM; 2 min rest | Max added weight or reduced assistance | Peer-reviewed |

### Low-intensity long-duration hangs

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (population-scale retrospective evidence; useful as low-cost adjunct).

**Purpose (targets):** Increase finger strength with lower per-session stress; useful when high-intensity finger loading is limited by recovery or injury risk. Best for Goal: all, especially **long-route** phases and “maintenance.”

**Mechanism:** Sustained submax isometrics may improve force transfer and tissue tolerance; in large real-world datasets, low-intensity long-duration protocols produced finger strength improvements comparable to max hangs, and combining low + high intensity showed additive effects. 

**Execution (practical adaptation of “low intensity long duration” concept):**
- **Setup:** edge and grip you can load lightly; keep feet on ground or chair.
- **Intensity:** “light strain” target (approximately submax; the study reports low intensity and frequent loading as the defining features). citeturn19view0
- **Work:** 10 minutes total time 10 seconds on 20 seconds off, alternate finger positions, front two, back three, etc.
- **Rest:** 20 s after 10 s on
- **RPE:** 4–6.

**Progressions:**
- Increase total time-under-tension modestly (e.g., +1–2 minutes) or add small load while keeping RPE moderate.
- Pair with max hangs (separate sessions at least 6 hours apart) if recovery permits; additive effects were observed when protocols were combined. 

**Regressions:**

- Reduce duration if any finger irritation appears.
- Change grip to open-hand or jug-like if crimp aggravates symptoms.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Smooth load, smooth unload.”
- “Keep it easy enough that you could repeat tomorrow.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Low intensity does not mean zero risk; pulleys/tendons still load. Use symptom check the next morning. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 2–4×/week (especially in base phases), or 1–2×/week as maintenance.

**Progress metrics:** Total weekly time-under-tension; next-day symptom score; periodic max hang test as outcome.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low-intensity long-duration hangs | Maintenance; endurance phases | ~10 min easy hangs (feet assisted) | Weekly time-under-tension; symptom trend | Peer-reviewed |

### Campus board ladders and power moves

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (intervention with explicit exercise menu and rest). 

**Purpose (targets):** Upper-limb explosive pulling and contact strength coordination (power/RFD proxies). Best for Goal: **bouldering**, and for cruxy rope routes requiring explosive moves.

**Mechanism:** Campus board training is highly specific to dynamic pulling without feet; in a five-week randomized intervention, campus training improved climbing-specific attributes (strength on climbing holds, maximal reach, moves-to-failure, and bouldering performance in some dosing patterns). 

**Execution (peer-reviewed exercise menu):**
- **Setup:** campus board with rung depth options (study used **25, 20, 15 mm** rungs and instructed climbers to use the shallowest rung they could and progress shallower when possible). 
- **Exercises (examples used):**
  - **1–4–7–10** (pull-through each move; match on top). 
  - **Ladder** (one hand stays; other climbs rung-by-rung to max reach and reverses). 
  - **1–2–3** (reach ~75% max then pull through for max). 
  - **10RM** (10 consecutive moves so move ten is near exhaustion). 
- **Sets:** **4 sets** per exercise performed in-session. 
- **Rest:** **2–3 minutes between sets** (regulated by perceived exhaustion), and all efforts performed with **maximal effort and velocity**. 
- **Technique constraint:** supervised instruction emphasized not using full crimp in their protocol.

**Progressions:**
- First: increase movement quality and consistency at same rung depth.
- Then: progress rung depth (25 → 20 → 15 mm) or increase reach distance.
- Option: shift frequency depending on goal—two vs four sessions/week produced different adaptation emphasis (RFD vs bouldering performance) in this study context. citeturn9view0

**Regressions:**
- Foot-on campus ladders (reduces stress) or perform controlled “big move” pulls on jugs.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Quiet hips; don’t thrash.”
- “Hit and hold—control the catch, don’t just slap.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Campus board is high stress for fingers, shoulders, and elbows; block periodization and reduced other high-intensity loads are recommended in the intervention discussion. citeturn9view0turn16view0

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–2×/week for most; or a short dedicated block (4–6 weeks) with reduced other intensity.

**Progress metrics:** highest rung reached; moves-to-failure; consistent completion of ladder at smaller rungs.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Campus ladders and power moves | Boulder harder; crux power | 2–3 exercises; 4 sets each; 2–3 min rest; max velocity | Max reach rung; move count; rung depth | Peer-reviewed |



### Hangboard repeaters with 7:3 rhythm

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (a standardized 7:3 repeater structure was used in a 10-week randomized trial). 

**Purpose (targets):** Strength-endurance for finger flexors and repeatability of contractions; most relevant to **short-route power** and **power-endurance with crux**, with some transfer for bouldering “capacity.”

**Mechanism:** Repeated submax isometric loading targets fatigue resistance and strength-endurance; in a 10-week trial, twice-weekly hangboard training improved climbing-specific maximal force outputs, showing that structured hangboard dosing can produce meaningful adaptations beyond regular climbing. 

**Execution (peer-reviewed structure):**
- **Warm-up:** 15 minutes easy climbing/bouldering. 
- **Set structure:** **2 identical sets** separated by **6 minutes rest**. 
- **Within each set:** **6 progressive hang-series**, each with **7 repetitions**. 
- **Each repetition:** **7 seconds hang / 3 seconds rest** (7:3). 
- **Rest between hang-series:** **2 minutes 30 seconds**. 
- **Progression rule:** increase difficulty when it can be done without failure (in the study, difficulty increased by grip conditions such as smaller holds/fewer fingers; timing variables stayed constant). 
- **Intensity (practical):** RPE 7–9 depending on series; early series easier, later series harder.

**Progressions:**
- Advance grip difficulty (smaller hold / fewer fingers) while maintaining completion.
- Keep rhythm constant; change only one variable at a time.

**Regressions:**
- Use larger holds or more fingers; maintain the 7:3 rhythm.
- Reduce to 1 set (instead of 2) during heavy climbing weeks.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Smooth transitions; don’t jump off early.”
- “Maintain scapular position; avoid shrugging.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Volume is substantial; deload every fourth week and avoid stacking with campus or limit bouldering the same day early in a cycle. Overuse prevention strategies emphasize managing cumulative load. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–2×/week depending on current climbing intensity (2× is the trial dose). 

**Progress metrics:** highest difficulty completed without failure; total completed reps; session RPE drift.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hangboard repeaters 7:3 | Route power; PE with crux | 2 sets; each set: 6 series × 7 reps; 7:3; 2:30 between series; 6 min between sets | Difficulty level completed; completion rate | Peer-reviewed |

### Intermittent hangs at 60% MVC with 7:2 ratio

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (optimized diagnostic protocol strongly correlated with lead climbing performance; can be repurposed as a training drill). 

**Purpose (targets):** Lead-relevant forearm endurance (repeatable contractions under a fixed work: rest rhythm). Best for **long-route endurance** and **power-endurance with crux**.

**Mechanism:** The 7:2 intermittent endurance test at 60% MVC was optimized to improve correlation with lead climbing performance; the rep count (with defined force/time tolerances) plus max strength explained a meaningful portion of climbing ability variance.

**Execution (training adaptation of the test):**
- **Setup:** fingerboard with force measurement if available (ideal). If not, approximate 60% MVC by load selection: choose load you can maintain for many reps but that becomes challenging with time.
- **Work:** **7 s on / 2 s off** rhythm. 
- **Intensity target:** ~60% MVC, RPE 6–8 (not max).
- **Sets:** 2–4 sets to “technical fatigue” (stop when you cannot maintain target force/time).
- **Rest between sets:** 3–5 minutes.

**Progressions:**
- Add repetitions before adding load.
- Tighten form: fewer “cheats” (shoulder hitching, swinging, grip shifting).

**Regressions:**
- Lower intensity (more assistance or larger holds).
- Use 7:3 instead of 7:2 if 7:2 is too aggressive early on.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Hit the rhythm; don’t sprint the first half.”
- “Relax all other muscles between contractions.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Although submax, total volume can be large; monitor next-day finger soreness and elbow symptoms. citeturn13search0turn13search6

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week in mixed plans; up to 2×/week in endurance blocks (separated by easy days).

**Progress metrics:** reps completed with consistent rhythm and minimal deviation; perceived pump at a given rep count.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intermittent hangs 60% MVC 7:2 | Route long; PE with crux | 7:2 rhythm at ~60% MVC; 2–4 sets; 3–5 min rest | Reps-to-failure / reps at fixed RPE | Peer-reviewed |



### Critical-force four-minute all-out intermittent test as a training drill

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (reliability established; validation work clarifies interpretation limits). 

**Purpose (targets):** Quantify and train the boundary between sustainable and non-sustainable forearm force; useful for **power-endurance with crux** when you want objective intensity anchors.

**Mechanism:** The “critical force” concept extends critical power; the 4-minute all-out test uses repeated 7 s maximal contractions with short rest (often 7:3) and can yield a “critical force” estimate, though validation work suggests common CF calculations may overestimate sustainable intensity depending on method. 

**Execution (as an occasional drill, not weekly torture):**
- **Protocol (test format):** 24 repetitions of **7 s maximal** hangs with **3 s rest** (7:3) over ~4 minutes has published test–retest reliability work. 
- **Training adaptation:** Instead of all-out, do **2–3 blocks of 2 minutes** at a target force slightly below “end-test” force, with 6–8 minutes rest between blocks.
- **Intensity:** RPE 8–9 for training version.

**Progressions:**
- Increase target force slightly once you can complete all blocks with stable technique.
- Extend total work time (minutes) before increasing intensity.

**Regressions:**
- Reduce contraction intensity or use assistance; maintain the rhythm.
- Use fewer reps or shorter blocks.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Maximal doesn’t mean sloppy—keep the same body position every rep.”

**Safety considerations:**
- High fatigue + intensity is a risk combination; use sparingly and avoid during finger pain flares. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 0–1×/week; commonly every 2–4 weeks as a benchmark-focused session.

**Progress metrics:** mean force in later reps (if measured), completion quality, and recovery time required.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical-force style intermittent test | PE with crux | 7:3 rhythm blocks informed by 4-min all-out structure | Later-block force stability; completion | Peer-reviewed |



### Interval bouldering and timed bouldering circuits

**Evidence level:** Peer-reviewed (interval-style bouldering is supported as an effective method in training synthesis; specific implementations vary). 

**Purpose (targets):** Power-endurance and repeatability of hard moves; best for **route power** and **power-endurance**, secondary value for bouldering “capacity.”

**Mechanism:** Training syntheses report that interval-style bouldering can improve endurance-related outcomes and may improve performance when programming is specific and structured. citeturn0search0turn2search3

**Execution (two common variants):**
- **Variant A: work:rest intervals**
  - Work: 20–40 s hard climbing (RPE 8–9).
  - Rest: 20–60 s.
  - Repeat: 8–16 rounds.
  - Sets: 2–3 sets; rest 6–10 min between sets.
- **Variant B: density block**
  - 10 minutes continuous “on/off” bouldering (climb, drop, rest briefly, repeat) at sustainable high effort.
  - Rest: 10 minutes.
  - Repeat: 2 blocks.

**Progressions:**
- Increase total hard work time first (more rounds or longer blocks).
- Then reduce rest modestly or increase problem difficulty one notch.

**Regressions:**
- Use juggier terrain or lower grades; keep the timing.
- Reduce to one set and keep quality.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Don’t sprint round one—pace so round six still resembles climbing.”
- “Shake out efficiently during rests; practice recovery behavior.”

**Safety considerations:**
- High pump encourages grip changes and sloppy catches; stop before repeated uncontrolled falls or finger tweaks. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week in most plans; up to 2×/week in a short power-endurance block with reduced other high intensity.

**Progress metrics:** total hard work completed at target RPE; completion of “last round” quality.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interval bouldering circuits | Route power; PE with crux | Timed hard bouts with incomplete rest; 2–3 sets | Total work completed; last-round quality | Peer-reviewed |



### Bouldering 4×4

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (conceptually overlaps with interval bouldering evidence; specific 4×4 structure is mostly manual/coaching). 

**Purpose (targets):** Power-endurance—ability to execute repeated near-limit moves with accumulating fatigue. Best for **route power** and **power-endurance**.

**Mechanism:** 4×4 is a structured density/interval session that creates repeated high-intensity contractions under limited recovery, similar in intent to interval bouldering approaches noted in training syntheses. 

**Execution (classic coach format):**
- Pick **4 boulder problems** about **2–4 grades below your limit** (hard enough to get pumped, doable when fresh).
- Climb each problem **4 times** with minimal rest between climbs (e.g., step off, chalk, go).
- After completing all 4 problems × 4 reps (16 total), rest **8–15 minutes**.
- Do **2–4 rounds** depending on goal and training age.
- **Intensity:** RPE **8–9**; you should not be failing every rep, but late reps should be shaky.

**Progressions:**
- Increase round count (2 → 3 → 4) before raising problem difficulty.
- Reduce inter-problem rest (within reason) before raising difficulty.

**Regressions:**
- Start with 3×3 or 4×3.
- Use easier problems but stricter “no extra rest” rules to keep structure.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Breathe on every move; relax between hand moves.”
- “Keep feet quiet even when pumped.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Avoid doing 4×4s in the same week as maximal campus blocks early in a season; cumulative fatigue and sloppy catching elevate injury risk. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1 session/week during a power-endurance mesocycle; 0–1× outside that block.

**Progress metrics:** rounds completed at target grade; number of falls; recovery time between rounds.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bouldering 4×4 | Route power; PE with crux | 4 problems × 4 reps; 2–4 rounds; 8–15 min between rounds | Rounds at same grade; fall count | Coach-practice |



### ARC traverses and continuous easy mileage

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by endurance determinants and lead demand models). citeturn8search10turn14search5

**Purpose (targets):** Local aerobic capacity in forearms, recovery between moves, and movement economy. Best for **long-route endurance**; also supports power-endurance by improving recovery kinetics.

**Mechanism:** Systematic reviews of climbing determinants emphasize the value of well-trained forearm flexors with high aerobic capacity and efficient style; competition lead structure is multi-minute intermittent work, aligning with long-duration submax training. citeturn8search10turn14search5

**Execution (ARC session):**
- **Intensity:** very easy; RPE **3–5**; “light pump only,” conversational breathing.
- **Work:** 20–45 minutes total continuous climbing (traverse, up/down, or alternating easy routes).
- **Rest:** minimal; if you must rest, keep rests short (20–60 s) and resume.
- **Technique constraint:** use a technique focus (quiet feet or no readjusting) to reinforce economy under low stress.

**Progressions:**
- Increase total time first (20 → 30 → 40+).
- Then slightly increase difficulty while keeping “light pump.”

**Regressions:**
- Shorter blocks (10–15 minutes) with longer rests.
- Larger holds / less steep walls.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Relax your hands as soon as you’re stable.”
- “Hips close; push with legs; avoid overgripping.”

**Safety considerations:**
- ARC is low intensity but high volume; skin and shoulder overuse can still accumulate. Monitor weekly load. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–3×/week depending on goal block (higher for long-route).

**Progress metrics:** minutes climbed at “light pump”; heart rate or breathing comfort (optional); reduced stop time.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ARC traverses | Route long | 20–45 min continuous easy climbing, light pump | Minutes at target pump; stop-time 감소 | Coach-practice |



### Long interval laps on routes

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (anchored in lead competition duration and endurance determinants). 

**Purpose (targets):** Sustained endurance closer to long-route intensity than ARC; pacing and shakeout tactics. Best for **route long** and **power-endurance**.

**Mechanism:** Lead climbing’s multi-minute structure suggests benefits from training that sits near a sustainable threshold, practicing both physiological tolerance and tactical behaviors (resting, clipping rhythm). 

**Execution (two formats):**
- **Format A: route laps**
  - Choose 1–2 routes you can climb with effort but not fail when fresh (RPE 6–8).
  - Climb up, lower, rest 3–6 min, repeat 3–6 times.
- **Format B: time-based intervals**
  - Work: 6–10 minutes climbing (continuous or with micro-rests).
  - Rest: 4–6 minutes.
  - Repeat: 3–5 rounds.

**Progressions:**
- Add one lap or one interval before increasing route grade.
- Reduce rest slightly once stable (e.g., 6 min → 5 min).

**Regressions:**
- Use easier routes or shorter work intervals.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Shake earlier than you think—practice proactive rests.”
- “Clip efficiently: one breath, one clip.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Fatigue may degrade movement; stop before repeated sloppy clipping and unsafe falls (especially when lead climbing).

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week (2× in endurance blocks if intensity is managed).

**Progress metrics:** total vertical meters or total “work minutes”; reduced falls; improved recovery between laps.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Long interval laps | Route long; PE with crux | 3–5 × (6–10 min on / 4–6 min off) | Total minutes at target intensity | Coach-practice |

### Route redpoint burn templates

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by specificity logic and research noting discipline prioritization can be implemented while maintaining the other discipline at low intensity). 

**Purpose (targets):** Redpoint execution, tactical pacing, and decision-making under realistic rests. Best for **route power**, **route long**, and **power-endurance with crux**.

**Mechanism:** Climbing performance often fails on execution (beta, pacing, clipping errors) rather than physiology alone; structured burns impose realistic decision-making and allow consistent tracking. Training research on prioritization supports the idea of focusing most work on the target discipline while maintaining the other discipline at low intensity. 

**Execution (template with measurable structure):**
- Pick one project route (or a route pair: one for volume, one for crux).
- **Burn 1 (beta):** RPE 6–7, stop at crux, rehearsal.
- **Burn 2 (send attempt):** RPE 9–10, full go.
- **Burn 3 (link attempt):** depends on outcome; either repeat crux section or attempt full again.
- **Rest:** 15–30 minutes between max burns; record exact rest used.

**Progressions:**
- Move from “section rehearsal” to “two-section links” to “full redpoint burns.”
- Reduce the number of total burns but increase quality as peak approaches.

**Regressions:**
- If recovery is poor, do only 2 burns and emphasize rehearsal (not repeated failure).

**Coaching cues:**
- “Record what happened immediately: where, why, and what to change.”
- “Treat rests as part of the drill: breathing, shake sequence, chalk routine.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Multiple near-max burns can overload fingers when fatigue is high; cap attempts when form collapses. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1 “burn day” per week as main specific session in many plans.

**Progress metrics:** high point changes; crux success rate; number of clips reached; rest effectiveness.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Redpoint burn template | Route power / long / PE-crux | 2–3 structured burns with long rest; log outcomes | High point; crux success | Coach-practice |



### Linked crux simulations

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by lead load structure and contact-time/fluency analysis). citeturn14search5turn21view0

**Purpose (targets):** Execute a difficult crux after fatigue accumulation; best for **power-endurance with crux**.

**Mechanism:** Lead climbing involves repeated actions and sustained contact times; failure often occurs at a crux under accumulated fatigue. Training that places the crux late increases specificity. Additionally, fluency/contact-time research suggests that reducing time on holds at difficult points relates to better outcomes, supporting drills that target efficient crux movement under stress. 

**Execution (crux-at-end format):**
- **Part A (pre-fatigue):** climb 2–4 minutes at moderate intensity (RPE 6–7).
- **Immediate transition:** step into a fixed crux sequence (8–15 moves) at RPE 9.
- **Rest:** 10–15 minutes.
- **Repeat:** 3–5 total rounds.

**Progressions:**
- Increase crux difficulty first, then lengthen pre-fatigue time.
- Track and improve crux completion percentage late in session.

**Regressions:**
- Shorten pre-fatigue to 60–90 seconds.
- Reduce crux difficulty or shorten sequence.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Same beta every round; don’t keep changing unless there’s a clear insight.”
- “Economy over aggression: hit positions, then move.”

**Safety considerations:**
- High fatigue raises fall risk and sloppy catches; on boulders, manage landing/spotting; on routes, manage clipping and fall potential.

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week during a specific PE-crux block.

**Progress metrics:** crux completion rate in rounds 3–5; number of attempts needed to stick crux.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linked crux simulations | PE with crux | 3–5 rounds: 2–4 min moderate + crux; 10–15 min rest | Late-round crux success | Coach-practice |

### Silent feet and precision footwork

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by motor learning framing in official development frameworks). 

**Purpose (targets):** Foot placement precision, reduced wasted movement, improved balance. Useful across all goals; especially valuable for **long-route endurance** (efficiency) and for bouldering movement quality.

**Mechanism:** A major portion of climbing is solving a physical “puzzle,” and long-term development frameworks explicitly emphasize motor learning and building a repertoire of movements; footwork drills create constraints that improve movement organization. 

**Execution (silent feet drill):**
- Choose easy terrain (RPE 2–4).
- Rule: every foot placement must be silent and “one-and-done” (no scraping).
- Climb 10–20 minutes of easy routes/traverses, or do 6–10 easy laps.
- Optional pressure: use a metronome for steady cadence (economy + controlled tempo).

**Progressions:**
- Increase difficulty slightly while preserving silence.
- Add constraint: “no hand readjustments” or “two-second pause after each move.”

**Regressions:**
- Larger footholds; reduce tempo constraint.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Place, then weight—don’t stomp.”
- “Hips move first; feet follow.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Keep intensity low; the goal is skill, not fatigue. If you start slipping due to pump, the drill has drifted from its intent.

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–3×/week as warm-up primer or low-intensity finisher.

**Progress metrics:** subjective “quiet score” (1–5), reduced slips, improved cadence stability.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Silent feet | All goals | 10–20 min easy climbing with silent, precise placements | Slip count; quiet score | Coach-practice |

### Movement economy and fluency drills

**Evidence level:** Mixed (peer-reviewed measurement basis; drill is coach-practice)

**Purpose (targets):** Reduce unnecessary stop time and contact time at key points; improve pacing and smoothness. Strong for **route long** and **power-endurance**.

**Mechanism:** Instrumented-hold research shows that faster climbers at crux points tended to have shorter total climbing time and that contact-time feedback can inform motor organization. Determinants reviews also highlight optimized kinematic motions as favorable. 

**Execution (no-stops fluency laps):**
- Choose a route/circuit at RPE 5–7.
- Rule: you may not stop moving for more than 2 seconds unless at a designated rest hold.
- Do 4–8 laps with 3–5 minutes easy rest between.
- Record: total time, number of stops >2 s, and where stops occur (hold number or clip number).

**Progressions:**
- Reduce allowed stop threshold (2 s → 1 s).
- Increase route difficulty slightly while maintaining stop control.

**Regressions:**
- Use easier terrain or allow designated “pause zones.”

**Coaching cues:**
- “Look two moves ahead; don’t solve one move at a time.”
- “Practice micro-shakes: 1 breath only.”

**Safety considerations:**
- On lead, stopping too little can create unsafe clipping; integrate “clip zones” where stopping is allowed for safety.

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–2×/week (often embedded in endurance sessions).

**Progress metrics:** time to top; stop count; time spent stopped; perceived pump at identical time.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fluency laps (no-stops) | Route long; PE with crux | 4–8 laps; limited stop time; log stops and time | Time; stop-count; stop-time | Coach-practice (measurement peer-reviewed) |



### Deadpoint and controlled dynamic movement drills

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by bouldering demands and power/RFD determinants). citeturn14search3turn0search12

**Purpose (targets):** Timing, coordination, and controlled dynamic contacts. Best for **bouldering** and cruxy sport routes.

**Mechanism:** Boulderers show higher rapid force capacity and finger strength compared to lead specialists in climbing-specific testing research, supporting drills that emphasize quick force production and controlled catching. 

**Execution (deadpoint ladder):**
- Choose terrain with safe fall (good pads, clear landing).
- Pick a sequence of 5–8 moves with 2–3 “deadpoint” moves.
- Do sets of **3 attempts** on the dynamic move, then climb the full sequence once.
- **Rest:** 2–4 minutes between attempts; 6–8 minutes between sets.
- **Sets:** 3–5 sets over session.
- **Intensity:** RPE 7–9 (not max dyno every time; focus on precision).

**Progressions:**
- Increase distance gradually or reduce positive holds.
- Add constraint: “stick and hold for 2 seconds” to enforce control.

**Regressions:**
- Smaller distance, better holds, or use a rope on high walls.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Push legs first; hands arrive second.”
- “Catch softly; don’t shock-load the fingers.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Dynamic catches can spike finger and shoulder loads; if fingers are sore or skin is compromised, downgrade to controlled moves. Overuse risk is non-trivial. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week in a power phase; as little as once every 10–14 days in maintenance.

**Progress metrics:** success rate on dynamic move; “stick quality”; peak move achieved with control.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deadpoint practice | Boulder harder; route crux power | 3–5 sets; 3 attempts per dynamic move; long rest | Success rate; distance achieved | Coach-practice |



### Lock-off isometrics on wall or bar

**Evidence level:** Coach-practice (supported by climbing test literature recognizing bent-arm hang and upper-limb strength measures as discriminative). 

**Purpose (targets):** Mid-range pulling isometrics, body tension, and stability at clips/rests. Useful across goals; especially **route power** (crux positions) and **long-route** (rest efficiency).

**Mechanism:** Reviews of performance testing indicate climbing-specific strength-endurance measures (including hanging and bent-arm related tests) can discriminate performance levels; lock-off drills are a constrained method to build stability in those positions. 

**Execution (on-wall lock set):**
- Choose an easy–moderate route (RPE 4–6).
- Every 3rd move, pause and hold a lock at ~90° elbow angle for **3–5 seconds**.
- Climb 4–8 laps with 3–5 minutes rest.
- Option: use two angles—90° and 120°.

**Progressions:**
- Increase lock duration (3 s → 5 s → 7 s).
- Increase frequency (every 4th move → every 3rd).

**Regressions:**
- Use larger holds or reduce lock frequency.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Shoulder packed; ribs down; no shrugging.”
- “Hips stay close; don’t let feet skate.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Lock-offs can irritate elbows/shoulders if volume is high; include antagonist and scapular stability work; monitor symptoms. 

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1×/week during technique/endurance phases; avoid stacking with maximal pulling days.

**Progress metrics:** number of completed locks; perceived stability; video-based body swing reduction.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lock-off pauses | Route power / long | Locks 3–5 s every 3–4 moves; 4–8 laps | Total locks completed; stability | Coach-practice |



### Antagonist and shoulder-stability circuit

**Evidence level:** Mixed (peer-reviewed descriptive data in climbers; drill is coach-practice).

**Purpose (targets):** Shoulder health, scapular control, pushing balance, and injury risk management. Supports all goals.

**Mechanism:** Climbers show characteristic shoulder rotator strength profiles compared to non-climbers, and overuse injury reviews emphasize prevention strategies and modifiable load factors; antagonist circuits are a practical method to address tissue balance and tolerance. 

**Execution (30–40 minute circuit, 2–3 rounds):**
- Scapular push-ups: 8–12
- Band external rotations: 12–20 each side
- Face pulls or reverse fly: 10–15
- Push-ups or dumbbell bench: 6–12 (RPE 6–8)
- Y–T–W raises: 6–10 each
- Core: hollow hold 20–40 s + side plank 20–40 s each side

**Progressions:**
- Add load slowly; increase range quality.
- Add a third round before increasing intensity.

**Regressions:**
- Reduce total exercises; prioritize external rotation + scapular control.

**Coaching cues:**
- “Move the shoulder blade deliberately.”
- “Quality reps; no neck tension.”

**Safety considerations:**
- Avoid painful ranges; if shoulder pain persists, seek clinical evaluation (do not “train through” sharp pain).

**Suggested weekly frequency:** 1–3×/week (often 2× when climbing intensity is high).

**Progress metrics:** loads used; symptom score; scapular control quality.

| Drill | Goal | Protocol | Progress metric | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Antagonist + shoulder stability | All goals | 2–3 rounds push/rotator cuff/scap/core | Loads; symptom trend | Coach-practice (supported by peer-reviewed profiling) |

## Drill-to-goal programming logic with visual mapping

A practical way to select drills is to map each drill to one primary limiting quality per goal, then ensure the weekly plan contains:  
- one **primary specific stimulus**,  
- one **secondary supportive stimulus**, and  
- at least one **skill/efficiency** constraint.

The flowchart below maps the drills above to the four performance goals. (Drills appear under multiple goals when they serve as support.)

```mermaid

  F[All goals: durability] --> D14[Antagonist + shoulder stability]
  F --> D18[Low-intensity long-duration hangs]
```

The rationale for “capacity” and “endurance” drill placement is grounded in the lead competition demand model (multi-minute climbing with repeated contacts) and in endurance determinants reviews emphasizing aerobic forearm capacity and efficiency. For bouldering drills, short attempt durations and the need for high strength/RFD justify long-rest, high-quality training emphasis. 

For technique drills, official development frameworks emphasize that success is strongly related to motor learning and building a repertoire of movements—supporting the inclusion of constraint-led skill drills (silent feet, fluency laps) even in physically focused blocks. 

## Four-week microcycles integrating drills by goal

Each microcycle below is a four-week block with progressive overload weeks followed by a deload/test week. The schedules assume 4 training days/week; add or remove a low-intensity technique day as needed.

### Microcycle for boulder harder

**Week structure intent:** high-quality limit output + max strength + a small amount of skill and durability. Short-burst demand modeling supports long rests and low “junk volume.” 

**Week 1**
- Day 1: Limit boulder sets + Silent feet warm-down
- Day 2: Antagonist/shoulder stability circuit + Low-intensity long-duration hangs
- Day 3: Max hangs + Deadpoint practice (short)
- Day 4: Campus ladders (reduced volume) + Fluency laps (easy)

**Week 2**
- Increase: limit attempt quality (fewer problems, harder) and/or add 1–2 max hang reps if tolerable.

**Week 3**
- Peak: Campus ladders at highest safe rung depth; keep limit session volume slightly reduced to avoid overload.

**Week 4 (deload + benchmark)**
- Replace one hard day with easy ARC.
- Re-test: max hang outcome; campus reach (optional), and 1–2 benchmark boulders.

**Drill count used:** 7–8 (limit, max hangs, campus, deadpoint, silent feet, fluency laps, antagonist circuit, low-intensity hangs).

### Microcycle for route power

**Week structure intent:** one primary power-endurance session, one secondary finger endurance/strength session, one execution day.

**Week 1**
- Day 1: 4×4 (2 rounds) + Silent feet (easy cooldown)
- Day 2: Antagonist/shoulder circuit
- Day 3: Hangboard repeaters 7:3 (one or two sets depending recovery) citeturn18view0
- Day 4: Redpoint burn template (2–3 burns, full rests)

**Week 2**
- Progress: 4×4 to 3 rounds or slightly harder problems; repeaters increase difficulty one step if completed cleanly. citeturn18view0

**Week 3**
- Add: interval bouldering circuits (short, 1–2 sets) instead of extra 4×4 volume.

**Week 4 (deload + benchmark)**
- Reduce PE volume by ~40–60%, keep 1 short high-quality interval set.
- Benchmark: “last round quality” and redpoint high point trend.

**Drill count used:** 6–8 (4×4, interval bouldering, repeaters, redpoint burns, silent feet, antagonist circuit, optional lock-off pauses).

### Microcycle for route long

**Week structure intent:** aerobic base + movement economy is the priority; maintain a minimum finger strength/endurance stimulus.

**Week 1**
- Day 1: ARC traverses (25–35 min) + Silent feet constraint
- Day 2: Antagonist/shoulder circuit + Low-intensity long-duration hangs
- Day 3: Long interval laps (3 × 6–8 min) + Fluency lap logging
- Day 4: Intermittent hangs 7:2 (2–3 sets, submax) 

**Week 2**
- Progress: +5–10 minutes ARC total, or +1 long interval.

**Week 3**
- Progress: slightly harder route intervals while preserving completion.

**Week 4 (deload + benchmark)**
- Keep ARC but shorten; replace long intervals with easy mileage.
- Benchmark: ARC time-at-light-pump and fluency lap stop-count trend.

**Drill count used:** 6–7 (ARC, long intervals, intermittent hangs, fluency laps, silent feet, antagonist circuit, low-intensity hangs).

### Microcycle for power-endurance with crux

**Week structure intent:** practice hard crux execution under fatigue, supported by endurance anchors and movement economy.

**Week 1**
- Day 1: Linked crux simulations (3–4 rounds) + long rest
- Day 2: Antagonist/shoulder circuit
- Day 3: Intermittent hangs 7:2 (2–4 sets) 
- Day 4: Redpoint burn template focused on linking past crux

**Week 2**
- Progress: increase crux difficulty slightly or add one round; keep total weekly failure attempts controlled.

**Week 3**
- Add: Critical-force-informed blocks (only if you measure force and tolerate it) OR replace with interval bouldering to expand work capacity. 

**Week 4 (deload + performance week)**
- Reduce linked-crux volume by half; keep one high-quality redpoint day.

**Drill count used:** 6–9 (linked crux sim, intermittent hangs, possible CF blocks, interval bouldering optional, redpoint burns, fluency/silent feet warm-ups, antagonist circuit).

### Safety notes tied to official coaching frameworks

Movement and safety teaching is central in formal instructor development frameworks. For example, the entity["organization","American Mountain Guides Association","training organization us"] Single Pitch Instructor handbook explicitly includes climbing movement instruction, movement exercises and games, and risk management elements for bouldering (pads and spotters) within its course structure. citeturn7view1 A long-term athlete development framework for sport climbing also frames climbing as a motor-learning-driven “solution to a physical and mental puzzle,” supporting the integration of technique constraints even inside physical training blocks. citeturn7view2
