# 12-Week Power-Endurance Training Plan (Goal 4) - 4 Days/Week

## Routes with Hard Moves, Endurance Demands, and Late Cruxes

------

## Overview

This plan is designed for the same goal—routes that require sustained climbing for several minutes while maintaining enough strength and power to execute a difficult crux sequence near the end when you're already fatigued. With **4 dedicated training days per week**, you have optimal frequency to:

1. Separate different training stimuli for better quality and recovery
2. Distribute volume across more sessions (reducing per-session fatigue)
3. Include dedicated technique/skill days
4. Progress faster while managing injury risk better than 3-day schedules

**Key advantage over 3-day plan**: You can separate high-intensity strength work from high-intensity endurance work, allowing better recovery between similar stimuli and potentially 15-25% faster progression.

**Key advantage over 2-day plan**: Much higher weekly volume (approximately 140-160% of 2-day plan), more frequent skill reinforcement, and more flexible session design.

------

## Pre-Plan Assessment (Week 0)

Same comprehensive assessment battery—testing doesn't change with training frequency.

### Assessment Battery

**1. Finger Maximum Strength**

- **Test**: 7-second maximum hang on 20-22mm edge (half-crimp grip)
- **Protocol**:
  - Warm up thoroughly (10 min easy climbing, progressive hangs)
  - Add/remove weight via belt or pulley system
  - Progress load in ~5kg increments
  - Hold each attempt for full 7 seconds with strict shoulder engagement
  - Rest 2 minutes between attempts
- **Record**: Maximum load held (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)

**2. Intermittent Finger Endurance**

- **Test**: Intermittent hangs at 60% of your max hang weight
- **Protocol**:
  - Work:rest ratio of 7 seconds on, 2 seconds off
  - Continue until form breaks down or force drops >10%
- **Record**: Total repetitions or total time

**3. Crux-After-Fatigue Simulation**

- **Protocol**:
  - 2-3 minutes continuous moderate climbing
  - Immediately attempt a fixed crux boulder (6-12 moves)
  - Rest 10-15 minutes, repeat 2-3 times
- **Record**: Success rate and moves completed

**4. Session Baseline**

- Duration, RPE, calculate sRPE (Duration × RPE)

**5. Injury Screening**

- Finger pain (location, 0-10 scale)
- Morning stiffness
- Shoulder/elbow symptoms
- Previous injury history

------

## The 12-Week Structure

Same mesocycle framework, but with 4 sessions per week allowing better stimulus distribution:

```
Weeks 1-3: Aerobic Base + Max Force Foundation
Week 4: Deload + Test
Weeks 5-7: Power-Endurance Build + Crux Simulations  
Week 8: Deload + Test
Weeks 9-11: Specific Linking + Redpoint Focus
Week 12: Taper + Performance Week
```

------

## Weekly Template

With 4 days, you'll use a carefully sequenced schedule that separates high-intensity stimuli by 2-3 days while keeping overall weekly load manageable:

### Recommended Weekly Schedule

| Day           | Session Type                 | Primary Stimulus               | Intensity    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Monday**    | Workout A: Max Strength      | Finger max hangs + pulling     | Very High    |
| **Tuesday**   | Workout B: Aerobic Base      | Long continuous climbing       | Low-Moderate |
| **Wednesday** | Rest                         | Recovery                       | -            |
| **Thursday**  | Workout C: Power-Endurance   | Intervals or intermittent work | High         |
| **Friday**    | Rest                         | Recovery                       | -            |
| **Saturday**  | Workout D: Specific Practice | Crux-after-fatigue / routes    | High         |
| **Sunday**    | Rest                         | Recovery                       | -            |

**Key principles**:

- High-intensity finger work (Mon & Thu) separated by 3 days
- Aerobic work (Tue) aids recovery from Monday while building capacity
- Specific practice (Sat) comes after 2 rest days for best quality
- 3 rest days per week for tissue recovery

**Alternative schedule** (if weekends are limited):

- Mon: Workout A
- Tue: Workout B
- Wed: Rest
- Thu: Workout C
- Fri: Workout D
- Sat/Sun: Rest

------

## Mesocycle 1: Weeks 1-3

### Build Aerobic Base + Establish Max Force

**Goal**: Establish a strong foundation in both maximum finger strength and aerobic endurance capacity. These qualities support everything that comes later.

------

### Workout A (Monday): Maximum Finger Strength + Pulling

This is your highest-intensity session of the week. Come in completely fresh.

#### Part 1: Maximum Hangs (35-40 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 10-15 min easy climbing + progressive hangs (50%→70%→85%)
- **Main work**: 6 sets × 10 seconds at 85-95% of max hang
- Rest: 2-3 minutes between sets (use full rest—quality is everything)
- Same 20-22mm edge, half-crimp grip
- **Week 1**: 6 × 10s at 85%
- **Week 2**: 6 × 10s at 88-90%
- **Week 3**: 6 × 10s at 90-93%

**Progression Rule**: If you complete all 6 reps with perfect form for 2 consecutive sessions, add 2-3kg. Never progress if any rep was questionable.

**Track**:

- Load used (BW ± added weight)
- All reps completed? (yes/no)
- Form quality (strict/slight degradation/failed)
- Finger pain during or after (0-10)

#### Part 2: Heavy Pulling Strength (20-25 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- 10 min rest after hangs
- Weighted pull-ups: 4 sets × 3-5 reps at heavy load
- Rest: 3 minutes between sets
- OR: Max pull-up hold (top position): 4 × 10-15 seconds
- **Week 1**: Find working weight for 5 reps
- **Week 2**: Same weight, aim for 5 reps all sets
- **Week 3**: Add 2-5 lbs if Week 2 was solid

**Track**:

- Load used
- Reps per set
- Form quality

#### Part 3: Antagonist/Prehab (10-15 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Shoulder external rotation: 2 × 15 reps
- Push-ups or dips: 2 × 10-15 reps
- Wrist curls/reverse curls: 2 × 12 reps

**Total Session Duration**: 65-80 minutes **Session-RPE**: Record 30 minutes after session ends

**Why This Structure**: Max strength work requires complete freshness. Pulling strength supports overall climbing power. Antagonist work prevents imbalances. Everything is done with full rest to maximize quality and minimize injury risk.

------

### Workout B (Tuesday): Aerobic Base Development

This is your lowest-intensity session—it should feel easy and help you recover from Monday while building aerobic capacity.

#### Full Session: ARC-Style Continuous Climbing

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 10 min very easy climbing
- **Main work**: 2-3 sets of 15-20 minute continuous climbing
- Rest: 5-8 minutes between sets
- Intensity: RPE 4-6 (light pump, conversational, sustainable indefinitely)
- Use traversing, circuits, or up-down routes
- Focus: smooth movement, breathing, efficiency
- **Week 1**: 2 × 15 min
- **Week 2**: 2 × 18 min
- **Week 3**: 3 × 15 min

**Track**:

- Total time climbed
- Average RPE per set
- Pump level at end of each set (1-10, should be 3-5)
- Movement quality notes (smooth vs. choppy)
- Did you maintain conversational breathing?

**Total Session Duration**: 50-80 minutes **Session-RPE**: Should be low-moderate

**Why This Session**: Builds local forearm aerobic capacity, improves movement economy, teaches efficiency, and serves as active recovery from Monday's high-intensity work. This is the foundation that allows you to manage multi-minute efforts on routes.

------

### Workout C (Thursday): Power-Endurance Intervals

This is your second high-intensity session of the week, but focused on endurance under intensity rather than maximum force.

#### Part 1: Route-Style Intervals (50-60 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 15 min progressive climbing
- **Main work**: 6-8 repeats of hard climbing intervals
  - Work: 60-90 seconds continuous hard climbing
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds (1:1 ratio)
  - Intensity: RPE 8-9 (should finish each interval pumped)
- Complete 2 sets of the intervals with 8-10 min rest between sets
- **Week 1**: 2 sets × 6 repeats of 60s work / 60s rest
- **Week 2**: 2 sets × 7 repeats of 75s work / 75s rest
- **Week 3**: 2 sets × 8 repeats of 90s work / 90s rest

**Track**:

- Intervals completed at target intensity
- Did you maintain quality through all reps?
- Pump level at end of each set (1-10)
- Recovery quality between intervals

#### Part 2: Core Conditioning (15 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Front plank: 3 × 45-60 seconds
- Hanging knee raises: 3 × 10-12
- Side plank: 2 × 30 seconds each side

**Total Session Duration**: 65-75 minutes **Session-RPE**: Will be moderate-high

**Why This Structure**: Intervals train your ability to sustain hard climbing with incomplete recovery—essential for route climbing. The 1:1 work:rest ratio mimics route climbing patterns (hard moves interrupted by brief shakes). Core work supports overall climbing efficiency.

------

### Workout D (Saturday): Crux-After-Fatigue Specificity

This is your most specific session—directly practicing your goal scenario.

#### Full Session: Crux-After-Fatigue Drill

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 15 min progressive climbing
- **Main work**: 5-6 rounds of the simulation
  - Part 1: 2-3 minutes continuous moderate climbing (don't fall, stay controlled)
  - Part 2 (immediately): Attempt a 6-12 move crux boulder sequence (RPE 9)
  - Rest: 10-12 minutes between rounds (full recovery for quality)
- **Week 1**: 5 rounds with 2-min lead-in
- **Week 2**: 5 rounds with 2.5-min lead-in
- **Week 3**: 6 rounds with 3-min lead-in

**Track**:

- Crux success rate (e.g., "4/6 rounds")
- Moves completed per attempt
- Quality of execution (1-5 rating: crisp to desperate)
- Pump level before crux attempt (1-10)
- Pacing notes (did you rush? manage breathing?)
- Mental state (focused vs. scattered)

**Total Session Duration**: 75-95 minutes **Session-RPE**: High but manageable with full rest

**Why This Session**: This is the entire point of the plan—can you execute hard moves when fatigued? With 4 days/week, you can dedicate a full session to this specific skill, practicing it fresh after 2 rest days for maximum quality.

------

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Purpose**: Reduce fatigue, allow adaptations to consolidate, reassess all metrics.

**Structure**: Reduce volume by ~40-50% across all sessions

**Monday (Workout A - Reduced)**:

- 4 × 10s hangs at 85% (instead of 6)
- 3 × 3 pull-ups (instead of 4 × 5)
- Antagonist work: same
- **Duration**: ~50 minutes

**Tuesday (Workout B - Reduced)**:

- 1 × 20 min continuous climbing (instead of 2-3 sets)
- **Duration**: ~35 minutes

**Thursday (Workout C - Reduced)**:

- 1 set × 6 repeats of 60s/60s intervals (instead of 2 sets)
- Core: same
- **Duration**: ~45 minutes

**Saturday (Testing Day)**:

- **DO NOT do Workout D**
- Instead: Complete full assessment battery
  - 7-second max hang test
  - Intermittent endurance test (60% MVC, 7:2)
  - Crux-after-fatigue benchmark
- **Duration**: 90-120 minutes (testing takes time)

**Track**:

- All test results with detailed notes
- Compare to Week 0 baseline
- Calculate percentage improvements
- Note any injury signals or concerns
- Recovery quality assessment

**Week 4 Review Questions**:

1. Which metric improved most?
2. Which metric needs more focus?
3. Any persistent pain or injury signals?
4. How's overall recovery and motivation?
5. Adjust Mesocycle 2 loads based on new max hang

------

## Mesocycle 2: Weeks 5-7

### Power-Endurance Build + Increased Specificity

**Goal**: Shift emphasis toward power-endurance while maintaining strength. Increase the difficulty and complexity of your specific drills.

------

### Workout A (Monday): Strength Maintenance + Power

Reduce max hang volume but maintain intensity; add some explosive work.

#### Part 1: Maintenance Max Hangs (25-30 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Warm up as usual
- 4-5 sets × 10 seconds at 85-90% (reduced volume from Mesocycle 1)
- Rest: 2-3 minutes
- **Weeks 5-7**: Maintain at 88-90% of updated max from Week 4 test

**Track**:

- Load used (should be stable or slightly increasing)
- Form quality
- Finger symptoms

#### Part 2: Campus Board or Explosive Work (25-30 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 10 min rest after hangs
- Choose 2 campus exercises per session:
  - **Option 1**: Max reach ladders (1-4-7 or similar)
  - **Option 2**: Controlled doubles (1-3-5-7)
  - **Option 3**: Max reach singles (find your limit)
- 4 sets of each exercise
- Rest: 2-3 minutes between sets
- Focus: maximum velocity and power, not grinding
- **Week 5**: Use larger rungs (25mm), learn movement
- **Week 6**: Same exercises, refine technique
- **Week 7**: Progress to smaller rungs (20mm) if ready

**Safety Note**: If campus board unavailable or too risky, substitute with:

- Dynamic boulder problems (coordination moves)
- Limit boulder sequences with explosive elements

**Track**:

- Highest rung reached
- Total moves completed
- Quality of execution
- Any finger/shoulder pain

#### Part 3: Antagonist/Prehab (10-15 minutes)

Same as Mesocycle 1

**Total Session Duration**: 60-75 minutes **Session-RPE**: High but shorter than Mesocycle 1

**Why The Change**: Maintenance volume on max strength is sufficient to preserve gains while you emphasize other qualities. Campus/power work develops rate of force development (RFD), which helps with dynamic crux moves.

------

### Workout B (Tuesday): Continued Aerobic Base

Maintain the aerobic foundation—don't abandon this quality.

#### Full Session: ARC Progression

**Structure**:

- Same format as Mesocycle 1, but extend duration:
- **Week 5**: 3 × 15 min
- **Week 6**: 2 × 22 min
- **Week 7**: 3 × 18 min

**Track**:

- Total time climbed (should be increasing)
- Pump levels (should stay low even as duration increases)
- Movement quality
- Breathing control

**Total Session Duration**: 60-85 minutes **Session-RPE**: Low-moderate (don't let this become hard)

**Why Maintain This**: Aerobic capacity supports recovery between crux attempts and helps manage the sustained portions of your routes. Don't neglect it just because mesocycle emphasis shifted.

------

### Workout C (Thursday): Intermittent Finger Endurance

Replace generic intervals with structured finger endurance work that's more specific to sustained climbing.

#### Part 1: Intermittent Hangs (45-55 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Warm up thoroughly
- Using 60% of your max hang weight (from Week 4 test)
- 7 seconds on, 3 seconds off pattern
- 4-6 sets to near-failure (stop 1-2 reps before form breaks)
- Rest: 3 minutes between sets
- **Week 5**: 4 sets
- **Week 6**: 5 sets
- **Week 7**: 6 sets

**Track**:

- Repetitions per set (should increase weekly or across mesocycle)
- Total time under tension
- Force consistency (did you maintain 60%?)
- Finger pain (0-10)
- Pump/burn sensation

#### Part 2: Light Bouldering (20-25 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Easy to moderate boulders (RPE 5-6)
- Focus: technique, precision, efficiency
- Volume: 8-12 problems
- This is active recovery and skill maintenance

**Total Session Duration**: 65-80 minutes **Session-RPE**: Moderate

**Why This Change**: Intermittent hangs at 60% MVC are validated for lead climbing performance. They build the specific endurance you need for sustained finger loading. The light bouldering maintains coordination without adding significant fatigue.

------

### Workout D (Saturday): Enhanced Crux-After-Fatigue

Increase the difficulty and complexity of your specific simulation.

#### Full Session: Progressive Crux-After-Fatigue

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 15 min
- **Main work**: 5-6 rounds of enhanced simulation
  - Part 1: 3-4 minutes continuous moderate climbing (longer than Mesocycle 1)
  - Part 2 (immediately): Attempt crux sequence that's HARDER than Mesocycle 1 (+1 grade)
  - Rest: 12-15 minutes between rounds
- **Week 5**: 5 rounds, 3-min lead-in, harder crux
- **Week 6**: 5 rounds, 3.5-min lead-in, same crux
- **Week 7**: 6 rounds, 4-min lead-in, same crux

**Additional Focus Points**:

- Practice efficient shaking during lead-in
- Experiment with pacing (faster vs. slower)
- Try different rest positions
- Mental rehearsal before each crux attempt

**Track**:

- Success rate (compare to Mesocycle 1—should be improving despite harder crux)
- Moves completed
- Quality rating (1-5)
- Pump management effectiveness
- Pacing notes (what worked? what didn't?)
- Mental state

**Total Session Duration**: 85-105 minutes **Session-RPE**: High

**Why The Progression**: You're adapting to the stimulus, so you need to increase difficulty. Longer lead-ins and harder cruxes force continued adaptation. This is still your most important session.

------

### Week 8: Deload + Retest

Same structure as Week 4:

**Volume Reduction**: 40-50% across all sessions

**Monday**: 3 × 10s hangs at 85%, 2 sets campus work (instead of 4), antagonist **Tuesday**: 1 × 20 min ARC **Thursday**: 3 sets intermittent hangs (instead of 6), light bouldering **Saturday**: **TESTING DAY** (not Workout D)

**Testing**: Complete full battery again

- 7-second max hang
- Intermittent endurance (should see significant improvement)
- Crux-after-fatigue benchmark (compare to Week 4 and Week 0)

**Week 8 Review**:

1. Track progression from Week 0 → Week 4 → Week 8
2. Identify trajectory: accelerating? plateauing?
3. Any injury concerns?
4. Adjust final mesocycle based on weak points
5. Update all training loads based on new max hang

------

## Mesocycle 3: Weeks 9-11

### Specific Linking + Redpoint Focus

**Goal**: Translate your improved physical capacities into actual route performance. Shift toward climbing routes rather than drills.

------

### Workout A (Monday): Minimal Strength Maintenance

Reduce strength work to bare minimum—just enough to maintain.

#### Part 1: Maintenance Hangs (20-25 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 3-4 sets × 10 seconds at 85-90%
- Rest: 3 minutes
- **Weeks 9-11**: Consistent load, focus on perfect form

**Track**:

- Load maintained
- Form quality
- Finger condition

#### Part 2: Route Attempts (40-50 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 3-4 burns on goal route or similar routes
- Full rest between burns (15-20 minutes)
- Focus: applying strength to actual climbing
- **Week 9**: Learn beta, find rests
- **Week 10**: Link sections, refine sequences
- **Week 11**: Go for sends

**Track**:

- High point each burn
- Beta improvements
- Energy management
- Quality of execution

**Total Session Duration**: 60-75 minutes **Session-RPE**: Moderate-high but controlled

**Why The Change**: Strength is maintained with minimal volume. Route attempts become the priority, allowing you to practice applying your fitness to actual performance.

------

### Workout B (Tuesday): Active Recovery + Technique

Shift to pure recovery and skill work.

#### Full Session: Easy Volume + Drills

**Structure**:

- 30-40 minutes very easy climbing (RPE 3-4)
- Focus areas:
  - Footwork precision
  - Hip positioning
  - Efficient shaking technique
  - Breathing patterns
- Volume: Just keep moving, no intensity
- Optional: 15 min mobility/flexibility work

**Track**:

- Total time
- Movement quality observations
- Recovery feel

**Total Session Duration**: 45-60 minutes **Session-RPE**: Very low

**Why**: You're accumulating fatigue from route attempts. This session aids recovery while maintaining movement patterns and addressing technical limiters.

------

### Workout C (Thursday): Threshold Intervals + Tactics

Work at threshold intensity while practicing route tactics.

#### Part 1: Sustained Hard Climbing (50-60 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 4-6 repeats of 2-4 minute threshold efforts
- Rest: 4-6 minutes between repeats
- Intensity: RPE 7-8 (sustainable hard, below redpoint effort)
- Practice: pacing, shake timing, clip positioning
- **Week 9**: 4 × 2 min
- **Week 10**: 5 × 3 min
- **Week 11**: 4 × 4 min (reduce volume before taper)

**Track**:

- Time at intensity
- Pacing consistency
- Shake effectiveness
- Technical observations

#### Part 2: Mental Practice (10 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Visualization of goal route
- Breathing exercises
- Mental rehearsal of crux under fatigue

**Total Session Duration**: 60-70 minutes **Session-RPE**: Moderate-high

**Why**: Threshold work maintains your power-endurance while you focus on route attempts. Mental practice becomes more important as you approach peak performance.

------

### Workout D (Saturday): Performance Simulation

This becomes your main performance practice day.

#### Full Session: Route Redpoint Practice

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 20 min progressive
- **Main work**: 4-5 full route attempts
  - Use goal route or similar difficulty/style
  - Full rest between attempts (15-25 minutes)
  - Treat each like a genuine redpoint attempt
  - No "working moves"—go for sends
- **Week 9**: 5 attempts, learning mode
- **Week 10**: 4 attempts, execution mode
- **Week 11**: 4 attempts, sending mode

**Track**:

- High point per attempt
- Falls/rests (where and why)
- Crux execution quality
- Energy at crux (1-10 scale)
- Beta refinements
- Mental state
- Success/failure + analysis

**Total Session Duration**: 90-120 minutes **Session-RPE**: High

**Why**: This is dress rehearsal. You're practicing the actual performance, not just drills. With 4 days/week, you can afford to dedicate a full session to genuine attempts.

------

## Week 12: Taper + Performance Week

**Goal**: Minimize accumulated fatigue while maintaining sharpness and executing your peak performance.

### Taper Strategy

**Monday (Light Maintenance)**:

- 2 × 10s hangs at 85% (very brief)
- 2 easy route burns (movement rehearsal only, RPE 5)
- **Duration**: 40 minutes

**Tuesday (Optional Easy Movement)**:

- 20 min very easy climbing OR complete rest
- Mobility work
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes or rest

**Wednesday**: **COMPLETE REST**

**Thursday (Activation)**:

- Very short session to "turn on" systems
- 3 × 5s hangs at 80% (just to feel the weight)
- 2-3 moderate boulder problems (RPE 6-7)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes MAX

**Friday**: **COMPLETE REST**

**Saturday (PERFORMANCE DAY)**:

- Goal route attempt(s)
- Treat like competition day
- Warm up thoroughly but don't overdo it
- 3-5 attempts maximum
- Full rest between attempts

**Sunday (Optional)**:

- If you didn't send Saturday, try again
- OR: Final assessment battery if you want closing metrics
- OR: Complete rest and satisfaction

------

## Complete Weekly Monitoring System

With 4 sessions per week, tracking becomes more important to avoid accumulated fatigue.

### Daily Session Log

| Date | Session | Type                         | Duration | RPE  | sRPE    | Key Metrics            | Finger Pain | Next Day           |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
|      | A/B/C/D | Strength/Aerobic/PE/Specific | min      | 0-10 | Dur×RPE | Load/reps/time/success | 0-10        | Stiffness/soreness |

### Weekly Summary Tracking

Calculate these metrics each Sunday:

| Week | Total sRPE | Avg Daily sRPE | Max Session sRPE | Monotony   | Strain         | Injuries?   |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ----------- |
|      | Sum all 4  | Total÷4        | Highest single   | SD of sRPE | Total×Monotony | Y/N + notes |

**Monotony** = Average sRPE ÷ Standard Deviation of sRPE

- High monotony (>2.0) with high load = injury risk
- Solution: Vary intensity more or insert easier session

**Strain** = Total weekly sRPE × Monotony

- Track trend: rapid increases in strain = red flag

### Injury Risk Signals (Check Weekly)

| Signal                       | Threshold           | Action Required     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Finger pain trend            | Increasing 3+ weeks | Immediate deload    |
| Morning stiffness            | >30 min, 4+ days    | Reduce volume 30%   |
| Strain week-to-week increase | >20% jump           | Add recovery day    |
| Session quality declining    | 2+ weeks            | Deload week         |
| Motivation drop              | Dreading sessions   | Mental break needed |

------

## Progression Rules (Optimized for 4-Day Schedule)

### For Hangboard (Workout A):

**Mesocycle 1 (Weeks 1-3)**:

- Progress every 1-2 sessions if form is perfect
- Add 2-3kg when 6/6 reps completed with strict form for 2 consecutive sessions
- Never add more than 5% per week

**Mesocycle 2-3 (Weeks 5-11)**:

- Maintain load or add very conservatively
- Priority shifts to other qualities
- Only progress if it's effortless

### For Aerobic Work (Workout B):

**Mesocycle 1**:

- Increase duration by 2-3 minutes per week
- OR add one additional set
- Keep intensity LOW (RPE 4-6)

**Mesocycle 2-3**:

- Maintain duration achieved in Mesocycle 1
- May slightly increase intensity to RPE 6-7 but not higher

### For Power-Endurance (Workout C):

**Progression priorities** (one at a time):

1. First: Add reps/duration within sets
2. Second: Add sets
3. Third: Reduce rest slightly (maximum 10% reduction)
4. Fourth: Increase difficulty
5. Never progress more than one variable per week

**Mesocycle 2 (intermittent hangs)**:

- Add 1 set every 1-2 weeks
- Keep intensity at 60% MVC (don't increase)
- Stop progression at 6 sets

### For Specific Work (Workout D):

**Progression variables** (change weekly or biweekly):

1. Lead-in duration (2 min → 3 min → 4 min)
2. Number of rounds (4 → 5 → 6)
3. Crux difficulty (+1 grade when success rate >60%)
4. Rest reduction (only in final mesocycle, maximum 10%)

**Critical rule**: Never progress if success rate drops below 30% for 2 consecutive weeks. If this happens, make it easier.

------

## Safety Guidelines (Enhanced for 4-Day Schedule)

### Everything from 3-day plan applies, PLUS:

### Volume Management:

**With 4 sessions per week, total weekly volume is high**

- Weekly sRPE should generally be 800-1400 (depending on intensity)
- If weekly sRPE exceeds 1500 for 2+ consecutive weeks → injury risk
- If weekly sRPE varies wildly (e.g., 600 → 1400 → 700) → destabilizing

**Session Duration Caps**:

- Workout A: Maximum 90 minutes
- Workout B: Maximum 90 minutes
- Workout C: Maximum 80 minutes
- Workout D: Maximum 120 minutes
- If sessions consistently exceed these, you're doing too much

### Sequencing Rules:

**Never put high-intensity finger sessions back-to-back**

- Monday (max hangs) and Thursday (PE/intermittent) are separated by 3 days
- If you must adjust schedule, maintain 2+ day gap between finger-intensive sessions

**Never skip deload weeks**:

- Week 4 and Week 8 are MANDATORY
- With 4 days/week, accumulated fatigue is real
- Skipping deloads = high injury risk

### Red Flags Specific to 4-Day Training:

| Red Flag                                  | Likely Cause                     | Immediate Action                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep | Accumulated volume too high      | Insert extra rest day this week  |
| Pain in multiple finger joints            | Overuse across too many sessions | Full week off finger intensity   |
| Performance declining for 2+ weeks        | Inadequate recovery              | Extend current deload to 2 weeks |
| Dreading sessions                         | Mental/physical overtraining     | Drop to 3 days/week for 2 weeks  |
| Elevated resting heart rate (+10 bpm)     | Systemic overload                | Complete rest 3-5 days           |

### Deload Week Protocol (Weeks 4 & 8):

**Volume reduction by session**:

- Workout A: 40% reduction (4 sets instead of 6, 2 campus sets instead of 4)
- Workout B: 50% reduction (1 set instead of 2-3)
- Workout C: 50% reduction (3 sets instead of 6, skip Part 2)
- Workout D: **REPLACE with testing** (not a workout)

**Intensity management**:

- Maintain loads/percentages but reduce volume
- This preserves adaptations while allowing recovery

**Sleep and nutrition**:

- Deload weeks are when adaptations consolidate
- Prioritize 8+ hours sleep
- Maintain protein intake
- Consider extra calories (recovery is work)

## Making the Most of 4-Day Training

### Strategic Advantages:

**1. Separation of Stimuli**

- You can do max strength completely separately from power-endurance
- This means better quality in each session
- Also means better recovery between similar stresses

**2. Skill Reinforcement**

- 4 days/week provides excellent frequency for motor learning
- You're practicing climbing skills 4×/week vs. 2-3×
- This accelerates technical improvement

**3. Flexible Periodization**

- Can emphasize different qualities on different days
- Can adjust individual sessions without disrupting the week
- Can insert extra recovery or technique days as needed

**4. Performance Readiness**

- With 4 days, you can dedicate full sessions to performance attempts (Workout D)
- This is huge for translating fitness to actual climbing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

**1. "More is Better" Trap**

- Having 4 days doesn't mean more total volume is always better
- Quality > quantity still applies
- Watch your weekly sRPE trends carefully

**2. Intensity Creep**

- Easy days (Workout B) must stay EASY
- Don't turn Tuesday into another hard session
- Respect the low-intensity prescription

**3. Neglecting Recovery Days**

- The 3 rest days are not optional
- Don't add "just a little extra climbing" on rest days
- Recovery is when adaptation happens

**4. Session Length Creep**

- Sessions don't need to be 2+ hours to be effective
- Shorter, focused sessions often work better
- If your sessions are consistently >90 min, you're probably doing too much

| Specific sessions/week | 1           | 1           | 1           |

### Expected Outcomes (Week 12)

| Metric                 | 2-Day         | 3-Day       | 4-Day         |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Max hang increase      | +3-10%        | +5-15%      | +8-18%        |
| Intermittent endurance | +15-35%       | +20-50%     | +30-60%       |
| Crux-after-fatigue     | 1.5-2× better | 2-3× better | 2.5-4× better |
| Technical improvement  | Moderate      | Good        | Excellent     |
| Progression speed      | Baseline      | +25%        | +40%          |

### Time to Peak Performance

- **2-Day**: 16-20 weeks for full potential
- **3-Day**: 12-16 weeks for full potential
- **4-Day**: 10-14 weeks for full potential

### Injury Risk

| Schedule | Risk Level    | Key Management                                       |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-Day    | Low-Moderate  | Long sessions, session quality critical              |
| 3-Day    | Moderate      | Balance intensity, respect deloads                   |
| 4-Day    | Moderate-High | Volume monitoring critical, easy days must stay easy |

**4-Day specific risk**: The main risk is accumulated volume and doing too much. You have more opportunities to overtrain. Solution: strict adherence to intensity prescriptions and monitoring protocols.

## Alternative 24-Week Extension

For sustained long-term development with 4 days/week:

### Weeks 1-12: Foundation Phase (This Plan)

Run exactly as written above

### Weeks 13-14: Active Recovery

- 4 days of very easy climbing (RPE 3-5)
- Technique focus only
- No testing, no intensity
- Mental reset

### Weeks 15-26: Specialization Phase

**Modified weekly structure**:

- **Monday**: Route-specific max strength (harder cruxes, limit moves)
- **Tuesday**: Continuous aerobic (maintain base)
- **Thursday**: Sport-specific intervals (route simulations)
- **Saturday**: Full route attempts (redpointing focus)

**Mesocycle structure**:

- Weeks 15-18: Higher volume, moderate intensity
- Week 19: Deload + test
- Weeks 20-23: Lower volume, high specificity
- Week 24: Deload + test
- Weeks 25-26: Taper + peak performance

**Progressive emphasis**:

- Less hangboard, more route-specific pulling
- Less structured intervals, more route attempts
- Less drilling, more performance
- Maintain minimum effective dose of all qualities

## Quick Reference Card - 4-Day Version

### Weekly Structure

- **Monday**: Max Strength (hangs + pulling) - HARD
- **Tuesday**: Aerobic Base (ARC) - EASY
- **Wednesday**: REST
- **Thursday**: Power-Endurance (intervals or intermittent) - HARD
- **Friday**: REST
- **Saturday**: Specific Practice (crux-after-fatigue / routes) - HARD
- **Sunday**: REST

### Session Duration Targets

- Workout A: 60-80 min
- Workout B: 50-85 min
- Workout C: 65-80 min
- Workout D: 75-120 min
- **Total weekly**: 250-365 min

### Critical Monitoring

**Track every session**:

- sRPE (duration × RPE)
- Key metrics
- Finger pain (0-10)
- Next-morning recovery

**Weekly review**:

- Total weekly sRPE (should be 1000-1400)
- Monotony (low is better)
- Any injury signals
- Recovery quality

**Every 4 weeks**:

- Full test battery (Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12)
- Compare all metrics
- Adjust loads
- Review injury status

### Deloads (Weeks 4 & 8)

- 40-50% volume reduction all sessions
- Saturday becomes testing day (not workout)
- Maintain intensity where used
- Sleep and recovery priority

### Progression Philosophy

- One variable at a time
- Conservative finger loading
- Quality over quantity
- Respect the easy days
- Trust the process

## Final Thoughts

The 4-day plan represents an optimal frequency for most dedicated climbers:

**You'll make faster progress than 2-day or 3-day plans** because:

- Higher total volume distributed well
- Better separation of training stimuli
- More frequent skill reinforcement
- Dedicated session for each quality

**But you must manage the risks**:

- More sessions = more opportunities to accumulate fatigue
- Easy days MUST stay easy (biggest mistake is turning Tuesday hard)
- Monitoring is critical (sRPE tracking non-negotiable)
- Deloads are mandatory injury prevention

**Success with 4 days/week requires**:

1. **Discipline**: Following prescribed intensities (especially keeping Workout B easy)
2. **Monitoring**: Actually tracking your sessions and responding to data
3. **Recovery**: Using the 3 rest days properly (sleep, nutrition, stress management)
4. **Patience**: Trusting the progression rather than adding extra volume
5. **Honesty**: Stopping when quality deteriorates, admitting when you need extra rest

If you can commit to these principles, 4 days/week will likely produce the best results while remaining sustainable for most climbers. It's enough volume to drive significant adaptation, but not so much that recovery becomes impossible for anyone with normal life stress.

The key differentiator between good and great results on this plan is **adherence to prescribed intensities**—especially keeping the easy day easy and the hard days truly hard rather than everything being medium-hard.
