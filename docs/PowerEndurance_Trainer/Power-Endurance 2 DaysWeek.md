# 12-Week Power-Endurance Training Plan (Goal 4) - 2 Days/Week

## Routes with Hard Moves, Endurance Demands, and Late Cruxes

------

## Overview

This plan is designed for routes that require sustained climbing for several minutes while maintaining enough strength and power to execute a difficult crux sequence near the end when you're already fatigued. However, it's adapted for someone who can only commit to **2 dedicated training days per week**.

The key difference: each session combines multiple training stimuli, and you'll need to be more strategic about recovery since you have less frequency to distribute the load. The trade-off is that progress may be slower (potentially 60-75% of the gains from a 3-day plan), but you can still make meaningful improvements.

**Critical adjustment**: With only 2 days/week, you cannot afford injuries. Conservative progression and listening to your body become even more important.

------

## Pre-Plan Assessment (Week 0)

Same assessment battery as the 3-day plan—this doesn't change based on training frequency.

### Assessment Battery

**1. Finger Maximum Strength**

- **Test**: 7-second maximum hang on 20-22mm edge (half-crimp grip)
- **Protocol**:
  - Warm up thoroughly (10 min easy climbing, progressive hangs)
  - Add weight via belt or remove weight via pulley system
  - Progress load in ~5kg increments
  - Hold each attempt for full 7 seconds with strict shoulder engagement
  - Rest 2 minutes between attempts
- **Record**: Maximum load held (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)

**2. Intermittent Finger Endurance**

- **Test**: Intermittent hangs at 60% of your max hang weight
- **Protocol**:
  - Work:rest ratio of 7 seconds on, 2 seconds off
  - Continue until form breaks down
- **Record**: Total repetitions or total time

**3. Crux-After-Fatigue Simulation**

- **Protocol**:
  - 2-3 minutes continuous moderate climbing
  - Immediately attempt a fixed crux boulder (6-12 moves)
  - Rest 10-15 minutes, repeat 2-3 times
- **Record**: Success rate and moves completed

**4. Session Baseline**

- Duration, RPE, calculate sRPE (Duration × RPE)

**5. Injury Screening**

- Finger pain, morning stiffness, shoulder/elbow issues

## The 12-Week Structure

Same mesocycle framework, but condensed into 2 sessions per week:

```
Weeks 1-3: Aerobic Base + Max Force Foundation
Week 4: Deload + Test
Weeks 5-7: Power-Endurance Build + Crux Simulations  
Week 8: Deload + Test
Weeks 9-11: Specific Linking + Redpoint Focus
Week 12: Taper + Performance Week
```

------

## Weekly Template

With only 2 days, you'll alternate between two session types, with at least 2 days (preferably 3) between sessions:

### Option A: Tuesday/Friday or Tuesday/Saturday

### Option B: Wednesday/Saturday or Wednesday/Sunday

| Day                               | Session Type                        | Purpose                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Day 1** (e.g., Tuesday)         | Combined Session A                  | Strength + aerobic work       |
| **Day 2** (e.g., Friday/Saturday) | Combined Session B                  | Power-endurance + specificity |
| Other days                        | Rest or optional very easy climbing | Recovery and adaptation       |

**Important**: You need 2-3 full rest days between sessions because each session will be longer and combine multiple stimuli.

------

## Mesocycle 1: Weeks 1-3

### Build Aerobic Base + Establish Max Force

**Goal**: Create the foundation with minimal frequency but adequate stimulus.

------

### Session A (Day 1): Strength + Aerobic Base

This session combines max hangs with aerobic endurance work. The order matters: do strength work first when fresh, then endurance.

#### Part 1: Maximum Hangs (30-35 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 10 min easy climbing + progressive hangs
- 6 sets × 10 seconds at 85-95% of max hang
- 2-3 minutes rest between sets (longer than 3-day plan due to limited frequency)
- **Week 1**: 6 × 10s at 85%
- **Week 2**: 6 × 10s at 87-90%
- **Week 3**: 6 × 10s at 90-92%

**Track**:

- Load used (BW + added weight)
- All reps completed? (yes/no)
- Form quality
- Finger pain (0-10)

#### Part 2: Long Continuous Climbing (40-50 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- 10 min rest after hangs
- 2-3 sets of 10-15 minute continuous climbing
- Rest 5 minutes between sets
- Intensity: RPE 5-6 (very manageable, conversational)
- Use traversing, circuits, or up-down routes
- **Week 1**: 2 × 10 min
- **Week 2**: 2 × 12 min
- **Week 3**: 3 × 12 min

**Track**:

- Total time climbed
- Average RPE per set
- Pump level at end of each set (1-10)

**Total Session Duration**: 70-85 minutes **Session-RPE**: Record overall session duration × global RPE (assessed 30 min after session ends) **Next Morning**: Check finger stiffness, soreness

**Why This Combination**: Strength work requires freshness, so it goes first. Aerobic work can be done in a fatigued state and actually benefits from it (teaches efficiency under duress). This pairing ensures you hit both critical limiters in one session.

------

### Session B (Day 2): Crux-After-Fatigue Specific Work

This session is entirely focused on your specific goal: executing hard moves while fatigued.

#### Full Session: Crux-After-Fatigue Progression

**Structure**:

- Warm up: 10-15 min easy climbing
- Main work: 4-5 rounds of:
  - Part 1: 2-3 minutes continuous moderate climbing (don't fall)
  - Part 2 (immediately): Attempt a 6-12 move crux sequence (RPE 9)
  - Rest 12-15 minutes between rounds (longer than 3-day plan)
- **Week 1**: 4 rounds, 2-min lead-in
- **Week 2**: 4 rounds, 2.5-min lead-in
- **Week 3**: 5 rounds, 3-min lead-in

**Track**:

- Crux success rate per round (e.g., "3/5")
- Moves completed per attempt
- Quality of execution (crisp vs. desperate)
- Pump level before crux (1-10)
- Pacing notes (did you rush the lead-in?)

**Total Session Duration**: 90-110 minutes **Session-RPE**: Duration × global RPE

**Why Full Session**: With only 2 days/week, this session needs to be purely specific. No mixing in other qualities—this is your performance simulation day.

------

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Purpose**: Same as 3-day plan—reduce fatigue, allow adaptations, reassess.

**Structure**:

- Reduce volume by 50-60% (more aggressive than 3-day plan)
- Maintain intensity where possible

**Session A (Day 1)**:

- 4 × 10s hangs at 85% (instead of 6)
- 1 × 12 min continuous climbing (instead of 2-3 sets)
- **Total**: ~45 minutes

**Session B (Day 2)**:

- 2-3 rounds crux-after-fatigue (instead of 4-5)
- **Total**: ~50 minutes

**Testing**: Schedule for Day 2 or add a 3rd day this week just for testing

- 7-second max hang
- Intermittent endurance test
- Crux-after-fatigue benchmark

**Track**:

- All test results
- Compare to baseline (Week 0)
- Recovery quality (sleep, soreness, motivation)
- Injury signals

------

## Mesocycle 2: Weeks 5-7

### Power-Endurance Build + Threshold Work

**Goal**: Increase capacity for repeated hard efforts and improve your ability to work at higher intensities.

------

### Session A (Day 1): Intermittent Endurance + Strength Maintenance

This session blends finger endurance work with maintenance strength.

#### Part 1: Intermittent Finger Endurance (45-50 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- Warm up thoroughly
- Using 60% of your max hang weight
- 7 seconds on, 3 seconds off pattern
- 4-6 sets to near-failure (stop before form breaks)
- 3 minutes rest between sets (longer than 3-day version)
- **Week 5**: 4 sets
- **Week 6**: 5 sets
- **Week 7**: 6 sets

**Track**:

- Repetitions per set
- Total time under tension
- Force consistency
- Finger pain (0-10)

#### Part 2: Strength Maintenance Hangs (25-30 minutes total)

**Structure**:

- 10 min rest after intermittent work
- 4 sets × 10 seconds at 85-90% (reduced from 6 sets in mesocycle 1)
- 2-3 minutes rest
- Focus on quality

**Track**:

- Load used
- Form quality
- Any fatigue impact from Part 1

**Total Session Duration**: 70-80 minutes **Session-RPE**: Overall duration × global RPE

**Why This Combination**: Intermittent endurance is the priority in this phase, so it goes first while fresh. Strength maintenance comes second with reduced volume to manage overall fatigue.

------

### Session B (Day 2): Enhanced Crux-After-Fatigue + Threshold Intervals

This session increases the difficulty of your specific simulation while adding some threshold work.

#### Part 1: Crux-After-Fatigue Progression (60-70 minutes)

**Structure**:

- Same format as Weeks 1-3, but harder:
  - **Week 5**: 4 rounds, 3-min lead-in, harder crux (+1 grade)
  - **Week 6**: 4 rounds, 3.5-min lead-in, maintain crux difficulty
  - **Week 7**: 5 rounds, 4-min lead-in, maintain crux difficulty

**Track**:

- Success rate (compare to Mesocycle 1)
- Quality under fatigue
- Shake efficiency

#### Part 2: Short Threshold Intervals (20-25 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 15 min rest after crux work
- 4-6 repeats × 45-60 seconds hard climbing
- Rest 1:1 (45-60 seconds between)
- RPE 8-9
- **Week 5**: 4 × 45s
- **Week 6**: 5 × 60s
- **Week 7**: 6 × 60s

**Track**:

- Intervals completed at target intensity
- Power feel (explosive vs. grinding)

**Total Session Duration**: 80-95 minutes **Session-RPE**: Overall duration × global RPE

**Why This Combination**: Both elements are high-intensity, but the crux simulation is more specific so it goes first. The threshold intervals add anaerobic capacity stimulus while you're already warmed up and activated.

------

### Week 8: Deload + Retest

Same structure as Week 4:

- 50-60% volume reduction
- Maintain intensity

**Session A**:

- 3 sets intermittent endurance (instead of 6)
- 3 × 10s hangs at 85% (instead of 4)

**Session B**:

- 2-3 rounds crux-after-fatigue (instead of 4-5)
- 3 × 45s threshold intervals (instead of 6)

**Testing**: Repeat full assessment battery

- Compare to Week 4 and Week 0
- Adjust loads based on new max hang
- Check trajectory: Is crux-after-fatigue improving?

------

## Mesocycle 3: Weeks 9-11

### Specific Linking + Redpoint Practice

**Goal**: Apply improved capacity to route attempts, refine tactics and execution.

------

### Session A (Day 1): Route Practice + Strength Maintenance

This session shifts toward performance attempts with minimal strength maintenance.

#### Part 1: Route Linking Practice (60-75 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 4-6 high-quality burns on routes similar to your goal
- Full rest (15-20 minutes) between attempts
- Focus: efficiency, pacing, shake placement, beta refinement
- No junk volume—every burn has a purpose
- **Week 9**: 4 burns, focus on lower section efficiency
- **Week 10**: 5 burns, practice full links
- **Week 11**: 5-6 burns, prioritize sending

**Track**:

- High point achieved each burn
- Number of falls/rests
- Pump level at crux (1-10)
- Tactical observations (beta changes, rest improvements)
- Quality rating (1-5 for each burn)

#### Part 2: Minimal Strength Maintenance (20-25 minutes)

**Structure**:

- 15 min rest after routes
- 3 × 10s hangs at 85-90% (minimal dose)
- 3 minutes rest between sets

**Track**:

- Load maintained
- Form quality despite route fatigue

**Total Session Duration**: 80-100 minutes **Session-RPE**: Overall duration × global RPE

------

### Session B (Day 2): Performance-Focused Simulation

#### Full Session: Competition-Style Crux-After-Fatigue (70-90 minutes)

**Structure**:

- This is your "mock performance" day
- 3-4 rounds of:
  - Extended lead-in (4-5 minutes continuous)
  - Immediate crux attempt (your actual goal-route crux if possible)
  - Full rest (15-20 minutes)
- **Week 9**: 3 rounds, focus on pacing the lead-in
- **Week 10**: 4 rounds, focus on crux precision
- **Week 11**: 3 rounds, focus on complete execution (taper volume)

**Track**:

- Success rate
- How sustainable was the lead-in? (RPE 1-10)
- Crux execution quality
- Recovery between rounds
- Mental state (confidence, anxiety, flow)

**Total Session Duration**: 70-90 minutes **Session-RPE**: Overall duration × global RPE

**Why**: This becomes your "dress rehearsal" for the actual performance.

------

## Week 12: Taper + Performance

**Goal**: Minimize fatigue, maintain sharpness, attempt goal route.

**Session A (Day 1)**: Very light—Monday or Tuesday if performing Saturday

- 2 easy burns on goal route, movement rehearsal only
- 2 × 10s hangs at 85%, very crisp
- **Total**: 40-50 minutes, RPE 4-5

**Session B (Day 2)**: Performance day—Friday/Saturday

- Option 1: Attempt goal route (fresh, after 3-4 rest days)
- Option 2: Final assessment battery if not attempting route

**Track**:

- Performance outcome
- How did the crux feel relative to 12 weeks ago?
- Final test results if conducted

------

## Weekly Monitoring System

Same tracking structure as 3-day plan, but with only 2 sessions per week:

| Date | Session | Duration (min) | RPE (0-10) | sRPE | Key Metrics | Finger Pain | Notes                           |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
|      | A or B  |                |            |      |             | 0-10        | Sleep, stress, recovery quality |

**Weekly Review Questions**:

1. Did you get at least 2 full rest days between sessions?
2. Is sRPE per session creeping dangerously high? (If yes → reduce next week)
3. Is finger pain increasing? (If yes → immediate deload)
4. Are you hitting target volumes/loads? (With 2 days, you can't afford missed sessions)
5. How's recovery quality? (More critical with longer sessions)

**After each session**: Check next-day stiffness and soreness **Monthly (Week 4, 8, 12)**: Full test battery and comparison

------

## Progression Rules (Adjusted for 2-Day Schedule)

**For Hangboard**:

- Same rules as 3-day plan: add 2-3kg only when 2 consecutive sessions are perfect
- BUT: "2 consecutive sessions" = 2 weeks with only 2 days/week, so progression is slower
- This is appropriate—your tissues get less frequent stimulus

**For Intervals/Endurance**:

- Progress every 2-3 weeks instead of every 1-2 weeks
- Add volume first, then intensity
- With limited frequency, quality matters more than volume

**For Crux-After-Fatigue**:

- Same progression logic but slightly more conservative
- You get fewer reps per month, so each one counts more

**General Rule**: If in doubt, repeat a week instead of progressing. With only 2 days/week, you cannot afford injury setbacks.

------

## Safety Guidelines (Enhanced for 2-Day Plan)

### Everything from 3-day plan applies, plus:

**Session Duration Management**:

- Sessions will be 70-110 minutes (longer than 3-day splits)
- This means more cumulative fatigue per session
- **Stop criteria**: If session quality deteriorates significantly, end it
- Don't push through just to complete planned volume

**Recovery Is Your Limiting Factor**:

- With only 2 sessions/week, you should NOT feel chronically fatigued
- If you do, you're doing too much per session
- Better to do 75% of planned volume well than 100% poorly

**Red Flags Specific to Low-Frequency Training**:

- Needing >48 hours to feel recovered between sessions = too much volume
- Dreading sessions = probably overreaching
- Persistent finger soreness 3+ days after session = immediate deload

### Deload Weeks Are Even More Critical:

- Week 4 and Week 8: 50-60% volume reduction (more aggressive than 3-day)
- These are injury prevention weeks
- With limited frequency, overuse injuries can develop without you noticing

------

## Comparison: 2-Day vs. 3-Day Plan

### What You Sacrifice:

- **Frequency of skill practice**: Less motor learning reinforcement
- **Total weekly volume**: Approximately 65-75% of 3-day plan
- **Progression speed**: Adaptations may take 25-40% longer
- **Flexibility**: Can't adjust individual sessions as easily

### What You Maintain:

- **All key training stimuli**: Strength, endurance, specificity
- **Progressive overload**: Still present, just slower
- **Testing structure**: Same assessment schedule
- **Injury risk management**: Actually better due to more recovery time

### Expected Outcomes (Week 12):

- **Strength**: +3-10% max hang (vs. +5-15% on 3-day)
- **Endurance**: +15-35% intermittent reps (vs. +20-50% on 3-day)
- **Specific**: 1.5-2× better crux-after-fatigue (vs. 2-3× on 3-day)
- **Performance**: Meaningful improvement but may need longer runway to peak performance

------

## Making the Most of Limited Training Days

### Between Sessions (Rest Days):

You have 5 non-training days per week. Use them wisely:

**Active Recovery Options (Optional)**:

- Very easy climbing (20-30 min, RPE 3-4, pure technique)
- Mobility work (15-20 min)
- Antagonist exercises (push-ups, shoulder work)
- Walking, yoga, general movement

**Do NOT**:

- Climb hard "for fun" on rest days
- Add unofficial "easy sessions" that accumulate fatigue
- Ignore recovery signals because you "only train 2 days"

### Session Preparation:

- Get good sleep the night before
- Eat properly before longer sessions
- Arrive mentally ready (these sessions are dense)
- Warm up thoroughly (budget 15-20 minutes)

### Mindset Adjustment:

- 2 days/week CAN produce results—research shows meaningful adaptations from 2×/week training
- Your limit is not frequency but recovery capacity and consistency
- Every session matters—no "throw-away" days
- Think in terms of 6-month or 12-month improvement, not just 12 weeks

------

## Alternative 24-Week Extension

If you want to extend this plan, the 2-day structure actually works well for longer cycles:

**Weeks 1-12**: Run this exact plan (foundation + build) **Weeks 13-14**: Active recovery (very easy climbing only) **Weeks 15-26**: Run modified version:

- Weeks 15-18: Higher volume aerobic base
- Weeks 19-22: More aggressive power-endurance
- Weeks 23-26: Specific peaking + attempts

With 2 days/week, longer cycles with distinct phases often work better than short intense blocks.

------

## Quick Reference Card - 2 Day Version

**Weekly Structure**:

- **Session A** (Day 1): Strength + Aerobic or Intermittent Endurance + Maintenance
- **Session B** (Day 2): Crux-After-Fatigue + Specificity
- At least 2 rest days between sessions

**Track Every Session**:

- sRPE (duration × global RPE)
- All key metrics (load, reps, success rate)
- Finger pain (0-10)
- Next-morning recovery quality

**Test Every 4 Weeks**:

- Week 0, 4, 8, 12
- Max hang, intermittent endurance, crux-after-fatigue

**Deload Weeks 4 & 8**:

- Cut volume 50-60%
- Maintain some intensity
- Retest

**Critical for 2-Day Success**:

- Perfect attendance (missing sessions is devastating with low frequency)
- Session quality > volume (don't just "get through it")
- Recovery discipline (use those 5 rest days properly)
- Conservative progression (injuries cost you weeks, not days)

------

## Final Thoughts

The 2-day plan is not a "worse" version of the 3-day plan—it's a different strategy optimized for limited training frequency. You'll make progress, but you need patience and consistency. The climbers who succeed on 2 days/week are those who:

1. Show up consistently (every week, both days)
2. Execute sessions with full focus and quality
3. Recover properly between sessions
4. Progress conservatively
5. Think long-term (6-12 months, not just 12 weeks)

If you can commit to these principles, you'll be surprised how much you can improve with just 2 dedicated days per week.
