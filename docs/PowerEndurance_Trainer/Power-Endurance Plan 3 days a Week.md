# 12-Week Power-Endurance Training Plan 3 days a Week

## Routes with Hard Moves, Endurance Demands, and Late Cruxes

------

## Overview

This plan is designed for routes that require you to manage sustained climbing for several minutes while maintaining enough strength and power to execute a difficult crux sequence near the end when you're already fatigued. Think of routes where you might be climbing at a moderate intensity for 3-5 minutes, then suddenly encountering a V5-V7 boulder problem right before the chains.

The training philosophy combines three elements:

1. **Aerobic base** - so you can recover between moves and maintain efficiency
2. **Anaerobic capacity** - for sustained hard sequences and the crux itself
3. **Strength under fatigue** - practicing hard moves when you're already pumped

------

## Pre-Plan Assessment (Week 0)

Before starting, you'll establish baselines across several domains. These tests will be repeated at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 to track progress.

### Assessment Battery

**1. Finger Maximum Strength**

- **Test**: 7-second maximum hang on 20-22mm edge (half-crimp grip)
- **Protocol**:
  - Warm up thoroughly (10 min easy climbing, progressive hangs)
  - Use a hangboard with consistent edge depth
  - Add weight via belt or remove weight via pulley system
  - Progress load in ~5kg increments
  - Hold each attempt for full 7 seconds with strict shoulder engagement
  - Rest 2 minutes between attempts
  - Stop when you cannot complete 7 seconds
- **Record**: Maximum load held (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)
- **Why**: This tells you your absolute finger strength ceiling, which determines how "hard" the crux moves are relative to your capacity

**2. Intermittent Finger Endurance**

- **Test**: Intermittent hangs at 60% of your max hang weight
- **Protocol**:
  - Use same edge and grip as max test
  - Calculate 60% of your max hang result
  - Work:rest ratio of 7 seconds on, 2 seconds off
  - Continue until you cannot complete a full 7-second hang or form breaks down
  - Use strict termination: stop if you drop more than 10% below target force
- **Record**: Total repetitions completed OR total time
- **Why**: This simulates the sustained finger loading of route climbing and correlates with lead performance

**3. Crux-After-Fatigue Simulation**

- **Test**: Your most specific assessment
- **Protocol**:
  - Choose a moderate circuit or route section you can climb continuously for 2-3 minutes
  - Immediately after completing it, attempt a fixed boulder problem (6-12 moves) that's near your limit
  - Record: Success/failure, number of moves completed, perceived difficulty
  - Rest 10-15 minutes and repeat 2-3 times
- **Record**: Success rate (e.g., "1/3 attempts") and average moves completed
- **Why**: This directly tests your goal - can you execute hard moves when fatigued?

**4. Session Baseline**

- Complete one typical climbing session and record:
  - Duration (minutes)
  - Rate of Perceived Exertion / RPE (0-10 scale, assessed 30 min after session)
  - Calculate session-RPE (sRPE) = Duration × RPE
  - This will be your load monitoring metric throughout the plan

**5. Injury Screening**

- Record current state:
  - Any finger pain (location, 0-10 scale)
  - Morning stiffness in fingers
  - Shoulder or elbow discomfort
  - Previous injuries
- **Why**: Establishes a baseline for detecting overuse patterns early

------

## The 12-Week Structure

The plan uses three 4-week mesocycles:

```
Weeks 1-3: Aerobic Base + Max Force Foundation
Week 4: Deload + Test
Weeks 5-7: Power-Endurance Build + Crux Simulations  
Week 8: Deload + Test
Weeks 9-11: Specific Linking + Redpoint Focus
Week 12: Taper + Performance Week
```

Each mesocycle emphasizes different qualities while maintaining the others. You'll train **3 days per week** with specific rest days built in.

------

## Weekly Template

Here's the repeating structure (adjust days to fit your schedule):

| Day           | Session Type                                | Purpose                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Monday**    | High-Intensity (Workout A or B rotation)    | Main stimulus day      |
| **Tuesday**   | Rest or very easy movement                  | Recovery               |
| **Wednesday** | Strength Maintenance (Workout C)            | Maintain force ceiling |
| **Thursday**  | Rest                                        | Absorption             |
| **Friday**    | Specific Practice (Workout A or B rotation) | Application/skill      |
| **Saturday**  | Optional: Easy aerobic (ARC)                | Recovery + base        |
| **Sunday**    | Rest                                        | Full recovery          |

You'll notice the three mandatory workouts (Mon/Wed/Fri) are separated by rest days to manage fatigue accumulation.

------

## Mesocycle 1: Weeks 1-3

### Build Aerobic Base + Establish Max Force

**Goal**: Create the foundation - improve your low-intensity endurance and establish/maintain finger strength so the route's holds feel more manageable.

### Workout A: Long Intervals (Monday)

**What**: Sustained climbing at moderate intensity **Structure**:

- 4 sets of 6-8 minute continuous climbing
- Rest 4-5 minutes between sets
- Intensity: RPE 6-7 (you should be able to maintain conversation, mild pump)
- Use traversing, circuits, or up-down routes
- **Week 1**: 4 × 6 min
- **Week 2**: 4 × 7 min
- **Week 3**: 4 × 8 min

**Track After Session**:

- Total time climbed (target: progressive increase)
- Average RPE per set
- Pump level at end of each set (1-10)
- Next morning: finger stiffness (yes/no)
- Session-RPE (duration × RPE)

**Why**: Builds local aerobic capacity in forearms, teaches pacing, improves movement efficiency at submaximal intensities.

------

### Workout B: Crux-After-Fatigue Drill (Friday)

**What**: Practice executing hard moves while fatigued **Structure**:

- Part 1: 2-3 minutes continuous moderate climbing (don't fall)
- Part 2 (immediately): Attempt a 6-12 move crux sequence (RPE 9)
- Rest 10-15 minutes
- Repeat 3-4 times total
- **Week 1**: 3 rounds, 2-min lead-in
- **Week 2**: 3 rounds, 2.5-min lead-in
- **Week 3**: 4 rounds, 3-min lead-in

**Track After Session**:

- Crux success rate (e.g., "2/3")
- Moves completed per attempt
- Quality of execution (form, precision)
- Pump level before crux attempt (1-10)
- Session-RPE

**Why**: This is your most specific drill - it directly practices your goal scenario.

------

### Workout C: Maximum Hangs (Wednesday)

**What**: Build/maintain finger strength ceiling **Structure**:

- 6 sets × 10 seconds at 85-95% of max hang
- 2 minutes rest between sets
- Same 20-22mm edge, half-crimp
- **Week 1**: 6 × 10s at 85%
- **Week 2**: 6 × 10s at 87-90%
- **Week 3**: 6 × 10s at 90-92%

**Progression Rule**: If you complete all 6 reps with good form for 2 consecutive sessions, add 2-3kg. Never add more than 5% per week.

**Track After Session**:

- Load used (BW + added weight)
- All reps completed? (yes/no)
- Form quality (strict/slight degradation/failed)
- Any finger pain during or after (0-10)
- Session-RPE

**Why**: Maintains your strength ceiling so the route's crux moves remain at a trainable percentage of your maximum.

------

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Purpose**: Reduce fatigue, allow adaptations to consolidate, reassess progress.

**Structure**:

- Reduce total volume by 50%
- Maintain some intensity
- Example week:
  - **Monday**: 2 × 6 min intervals (instead of 4 × 8)
  - **Wednesday**: 4 × 10s hangs at 85% (instead of 6)
  - **Friday**: 2 rounds crux-after-fatigue (instead of 4)

**Testing**: Repeat assessments from Week 0:

- 7-second max hang
- Intermittent endurance test
- Crux-after-fatigue benchmark

**Track**:

- All test results
- Compare to baseline
- Recovery quality (sleep, soreness, motivation)
- Any emerging injury signals

------

## Mesocycle 2: Weeks 5-7

### Power-Endurance Build + Threshold Work

**Goal**: Increase your capacity to handle repeated hard sequences and improve your ability to work at higher intensities for longer.

### Workout A: Intermittent Finger Endurance Training (Monday)

**What**: Structured fingerboard work at moderate intensity **Structure**:

- Using 60% of your max hang weight
- 7 seconds on, 3 seconds off pattern
- 3-5 sets to near-failure (stop before form breaks)
- 2-3 minutes rest between sets
- **Week 5**: 3 sets
- **Week 6**: 4 sets
- **Week 7**: 5 sets

**Track After Session**:

- Repetitions per set
- Total time under tension
- Force consistency (did you maintain the weight?)
- Finger pain (0-10)
- Session-RPE

**Why**: Builds the specific finger endurance needed for sustained climbing, uses a research-validated protocol.

------

### Workout B: Crux-After-Fatigue Progression (Friday)

**What**: Increase difficulty of the late-crux simulation **Structure**:

- Same format as Weeks 1-3, but:
  - **Week 5**: 4 rounds, 3-min lead-in, harder crux (+1 grade)
  - **Week 6**: 4 rounds, 3.5-min lead-in, same crux
  - **Week 7**: 5 rounds, 4-min lead-in, same crux

**Track After Session**:

- Success rate
- Moves completed
- Pump management (did you shake out effectively?)
- Comparison to earlier weeks
- Session-RPE

------

### Workout C: Strength Maintenance - Reduced Volume (Wednesday)

**What**: Maintain max strength with minimal dose **Structure**:

- 4 sets × 10 seconds at 85-90% (reduced from 6 sets)
- 2 minutes rest
- Focus on quality over quantity

**Track After Session**:

- Load used
- Form quality
- Finger symptoms
- Session-RPE

**Why**: Keeps your strength ceiling high while managing overall fatigue from increased power-endurance work.

------

### Week 8: Deload + Retest

Same structure as Week 4:

- 50% volume reduction
- Maintain intensity
- Repeat full assessment battery
- Compare to Week 4 results

**Key Question**: Is your crux-after-fatigue performance improving? Is your intermittent endurance increasing?

------

## Mesocycle 3: Weeks 9-11

### Specific Linking + Redpoint Practice

**Goal**: Apply your improved capacity to actual route attempts, practice linking sections, refine tactics.

### Workout A: Route Linking Practice (Monday)

**What**: Work sections of your goal route or similar routes **Structure**:

- 3-5 high-quality burns on routes similar to your goal
- Full rest (10-20 minutes) between attempts
- Focus: efficiency, pacing, shake placement
- Don't "junk volume" - keep attempts fresh
- **Week 9**: 3 burns, focus on lower section efficiency
- **Week 10**: 4 burns, practice full links with rest
- **Week 11**: 4-5 burns, prioritize sending

**Track After Session**:

- High point achieved

- Session-RPE

------

### Workout C: Strength Maintenance (Wednesday)

**What**: Minimal effective dose **Structure**:

- 4 sets × 10 seconds at 85-90%
- Same protocol as Weeks 5-7

**Track After Session**:

- Load
- Form
- Any fatigue signs
- Session-RPE

------

## Week 12: Taper + Performance

**Goal**: Reduce fatigue, maintain qualities, attempt your goal route.

**Structure**:

- **Monday**: 2 easy burns on goal route, technique focus only
- **Wednesday**: 3 × 10s hangs at 85%, very light
- **Thursday-Friday**: Rest
- **Saturday**: Performance attempt(s) on goal route
- **Sunday**: Final assessment if not completed Saturday

**Track**:

- Performance outcome
- How did the crux feel?
- Compare attempt quality to beginning of plan
- Final testing if desired

------

## Weekly Monitoring System

Use this table format to track every session:

| Date | Workout Type | Duration (min) | RPE (0-10) | sRPE | Key Metrics | Finger Pain | Notes               |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
|      |              |                |            |      |             | 0-10        | Sleep, psyche, skin |

**Weekly Review Questions**:

1. Is sRPE trending up dangerously? (If yes → reduce next week)
2. Is finger pain increasing? (If yes → reduce intensity)
3. Are you hitting target volumes/loads? (If no → identify why)
4. How's recovery quality? (Sleep, soreness, motivation)

**Monthly (Week 4, 8, 12) Review**:

- Compare test results
- Adjust loads based on new max hang
- Identify weak links (strength vs. endurance vs. skill)
- Check injury screen carefully

------

## Progression Rules

**For Hangboard**:

- Add load only when 2 consecutive sessions are completed with good form
- Increase by 2-3kg maximum (~2-5% of load)
- Never progress both intensity AND volume in same week

**For Intervals/Endurance**:

- Add time/reps first (volume)
- Then reduce rest slightly
- Then increase difficulty
- Progress only ONE variable every 2 weeks

**For Crux-After-Fatigue**:

- First increase lead-in duration
- Then increase number of rounds
- Finally increase crux difficulty
- Quality > quantity always

------

## Safety Guidelines

### Stop Immediately If:

- Sharp pain or "pop" in finger (possible pulley injury)
- Pain increasing during session (not just fatigue)
- Swelling in finger joints
- Pain worse next morning than during session

### Reduce Volume/Intensity If:

- Morning finger stiffness lasting >30 minutes for 3+ consecutive days
- sRPE monotony (same high load week after week)
- Skin repeatedly splitting
- Motivation dropping significantly

### Warm-Up Requirements:

- 10 minutes easy climbing
- Progressive hangs (50% → 70% → 85% of working weight)
- Never start with maximum efforts cold

### Deload Weeks Are Mandatory:

- Week 4 and Week 8 are injury prevention, not optional
- If you skip them, overuse injury risk increases substantially

------

## What Success Looks Like

By Week 12, you should see:

- **Strength**: +5-15% increase in max hang
- **Endurance**: +20-50% more intermittent hang reps
- **Specific**: 2-3× better success rate on crux-after-fatigue simulation
- **Performance**: Higher success rate on goal routes, fewer attempts needed, better late-crux execution

------

## Quick Reference Card

**3 Workouts/Week**:

- **A**: Long intervals or intermittent hangs or route practice
- **B**: Crux-after-fatigue drill or threshold intervals
- **C**: Max hangs (maintenance dose)

**Track Every Session**:

- sRPE (duration × RPE)
- Key metrics (load, reps, success rate)
- Finger pain (0-10)
- Next-morning check

**Test Every 4 Weeks**:

- Max hang
- Intermittent endurance
- Crux-after-fatigue benchmark

**Deload Weeks 4 & 8**:

- Cut volume 50%
- Keep some intensity
- Retest

This plan is built on the research showing that climbing performance requires both physical capacity (strength, endurance) and the ability to apply that capacity under specific conditions (fatigued state, complex movements). The progression is conservative to manage injury risk while still providing clear adaptation stimulus.
