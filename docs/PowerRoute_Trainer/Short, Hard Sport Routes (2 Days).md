# 12-Week Training Plan for Short, Hard Sport Routes (2 Days/Week)

------

## Phase 0: Baseline Assessment (Week 0)

Same tests as the 3-day plan, but spread across 2 assessment sessions:

### Session 1: Strength Tests

- Finger max strength (7-second max hang, 20-22mm edge)
- Weighted pull-up 3-5RM test
- Baseline injury screen

### Session 2: Endurance + Performance Tests

- Intermittent hang test (60% MVC, 7:2 work:rest)
- Benchmark power-endurance route/circuit (2-3 min duration)
- Record: time, rests, pump rating

------

## Training Structure Overview

**Key Principle:** Each session must serve multiple purposes since frequency is limited.

**Mesocycle 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Strength Foundation + Base Endurance
 **Mesocycle 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Power-Endurance Emphasis
 **Mesocycle 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Route Performance + Taper

**Training Frequency:** 2 sessions per week, ideally 3-4 days apart (e.g., Tuesday/Saturday or Wednesday/Sunday)
 **Session Duration:** Expect 90-120 minutes since we're combining work

------

## Mesocycle 1: Strength Foundation + Base (Weeks 1-4)

### Goals

- Build max finger strength (primary limiter)

------

## Mesocycle 2: Power-Endurance Build (Weeks 5-8)

### Goals

- Maintain strength ceiling
- Route-specific capacity

### Structural Change

Now that base is established, we intensify the power-endurance work while maintaining strength with minimum effective dose.

------

**Session 1 (Tuesday): Strength Maintenance + Anaerobic Intervals**

*Warm-up (20 min):* Standard

*Block 1 - Strength Maintenance (25 min):*

1. **Max Hangs** (4 sets × 10 seconds)

   - Goal: Maintain ceiling while energy goes to PE work
   - Rest: 2 minutes

*Block 2 - High-Intensity Power-Endurance (40 min):* 2. **Route Intervals - Primary Stimulus**

**Week 5-6 Protocol:**

- 2 sets × 6 rounds
- 60 seconds ON (hard climbing) / 90 seconds REST
- Rest between sets: 10 minutes
- Intensity: RPE 8-9 on last few rounds

**Week 7 Protocol:**

- 2 sets × 8 rounds
- 60 seconds ON / 75 seconds REST
- Rest between sets: 10 minutes
- Intensity: Maintain RPE 8-9

*Execution:*

- Use steep wall or sustained route sections
- Stay on wall during rest periods (simulate real route)
- Track pump accumulation across rounds

*Block 3 - Easy Movement (20 min):* 3. **Recovery Climbing**

- Very easy routes for touch

1. **Focused Route Attempts**

   - 4-6 burns on goal route or parallel project
   - Full rest: 15-20 minutes between attempts
   - Priority: Link sequences, find efficiencies, dial beta
   - Film attempts for review

   Strategy per attempt:

   - Attempt 1-2: Work sections, find rests
   - Attempt 3-4: Link longer segments
   - Attempt 5-6: Go for send if feeling good, otherwise work crux

*Block 2 - Secondary Routes (30 min):* 2. **Volume/Variety**

------

## Mesocycle 3: Route Performance + Taper (Weeks 9-12)

### Goals

- Convert fitness to sends
- Manage freshness
- Maintain sharpness without accumulating fatigue

### Philosophy Shift

Volume drops significantly. Quality and specificity are everything. Each session has a clear performance objective.

------

1. **Max Hangs** (3 sets × 10 seconds)
   - Maintain previous loads
   - Perfect form priority over adding weight

*Block 2 - Light Intervals (25 min):* 2. **Power-Endurance Maintenance**

- 1 set × 5 rounds
- 45-60 sec on / 90 sec rest
- Intensity: RPE 7-8 (not maximal)
- Goal: Maintain capacity without fatigue

*Block 3 - Easy Volume (30 min):* 3. **Movement Quality**

- Moderate routes below project grade

### Weekly Summary (Critical for 2-Day Plan)

Since you only train twice per week, the weekly view becomes essential for catching overtraining or undertraining:

```
Week #: _____ (of 12)

Total Sessions: 2
Total sRPE Load: _____ (should be consistent week-to-week within mesocycle)
Average RPE: _____

Finger Health Trend:
- Pain: Improving / Stable / Worsening
- Stiffness: Better / Same / Worse
- Skin: Good / Managing / Poor

Performance Indicators:
- Hangs: Progressing / Maintaining / Declining
- Routes: Harder / Same / Easier
- Endurance: Better / Same / Worse

Life Stress Check:
- Work: Low / Medium / High
- Sleep average: _____ hrs/night
- Nutrition: Good / Okay / Poor
- Other training: _________________

Adjustments needed for next week:
_________________________________
```

------

## Modified Progression Rules (2-Day Specific)

### For Max Hangs:

- Progress more conservatively than 3-day plan
- If you complete all sets × 10 sec for **3 consecutive sessions** (not 2) → add 2.5% load
- Never add load if finger pain >2/10

### For Intervals:

- Progress every **2 weeks** instead of weekly
- Add 1-2 reps every 2 weeks OR reduce rest by 10-15 seconds
- **Never progress both volume and intensity in same session**

### Session Density:

- With only 2 days/week, each session must count
- **If you feel off (sleep <6hrs, sick, high stress):** Do the session but reduce intensity by 20%
- **Do NOT skip sessions unless truly injured** - consistency is critical with low frequency

------

## Recovery Optimization (Essential for 2-Day Plan)

With only 2 training days, your 5 non-training days become performance tools:

### Day After Session (+1 day):

- Monitor finger stiffness carefully
- Light activity okay (walking, easy yoga, mobility)
- Nutrition: Prioritize protein (1.6-2.0g/kg bodyweight)
- Sleep: 7-9 hours mandatory

### Middle Days (Between Sessions):

- Active recovery: Light cardio, hiking, swimming
- Finger massage/mobility
- Visualization practice (mental rehearsal of project)
- **No climbing** - resist temptation to "just do a little"

### Day Before Session (-1 day):

- Rest or very light activity only
- Good sleep critical
- Hydration check
- Mental preparation

------

## Critical Differences from 3-Day Plan

### What You Gain:

✅ More recovery time between hard stimuli
 ✅ Lower injury risk (fewer high-stress sessions)
 ✅ Better work-life balance
 ✅ Each session is highly focused
 ✅ Easier to maintain peak motivation

### What You Sacrifice:

❌ Slower absolute progress (expect 8-12% gains vs 10-15%)
 ❌ Less volume for movement skill development
 ❌ Less margin for error (can't afford missed sessions)
 ❌ Harder to separate conflicting stimuli
 ❌ Longer time to accumulate training adaptations

### Compensation Strategies:

1. **Perfect execution** - Every rep matters with low frequency
2. **Nutrition optimization** - Can't out-train bad diet with 2 days
3. **Sleep prioritization** - Adaptation happens during recovery
4. **Active visualization** - Practice moves mentally on off-days
5. **Technique focus** - Maximize skill per unit of climbing time

------

## Expected Outcomes (2-Day Reality Check)

Based on training frequency research and your document's evidence:

**12-Week Realistic Targets:**

- Max hang: +5-10% (vs +5-15% for 3-day plan)
- Endurance reps: +15-30% (vs +20-40%)
- Route grade progression: 1 letter grade or V-grade improvement (vs 1-2)
- Time to outcome: May need 16-20 weeks for results that 3-day achieves in 12

**Key Success Factor:** Consistency over 12 weeks matters MORE than perfection in individual sessions. Missing even one session per week = 50% frequency loss.

------

## Emergency Protocols

### If You Miss a Session:

- **Do NOT double up next session** - this causes injury
- Shift the week forward (Week 1 becomes 1.5 weeks)
- Resume normal programming; don't try to "make up" work

### If Fingers Hurt:

- **Pain during session >3/10** → Stop finger work immediately, do route practice only
- **Next-day stiffness >6/10** → Skip next hangboard work, routes only
- **Persistent pain** → Take full week off, reassess

### If Progress Stalls (4+ weeks no improvement):

**Check these factors:**

1. Sleep <7 hrs/night? Fix this first
2. Life stress high? Reduce training intensity 20%
3. Nutrition poor? Add protein and calories
4. Hangs too conservative? Verify you're actually at 85-90% load
5. Routes too hard? Drop project grade temporarily

------

## Why This 2-Day Plan Works

Despite lower frequency, this plan still addresses the research priorities from your document:

1. **Finger strength foundation** - Max hangs anchor every week of strength/maintenance phases
2. **Power-endurance specificity** - Combined strength + interval sessions hit the 1-3 minute route domain
3. **Adequate recovery** - 3-4 days between sessions prevents overuse injuries emphasized in your research
4. **Progressive overload** - Conservative but consistent progression within each mesocycle
5. **Testing feedback** - Deload weeks provide regular checkpoints
6. **Injury prevention** - Lower frequency inherently reduces cumulative finger stress

The trade-off is **time** - expect 16-24 weeks to achieve what the 3-day plan does in 12 weeks. But the plan is sustainable for working professionals, parents, or anyone with limited climbing time.

**Your commitment:** Make those 2 sessions completely non-negotiable. They're your training investment for the week.
