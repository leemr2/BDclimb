# 12-Week Training Plan for Short, Hard Sport Routes (4 Days/Week)

------

## Phase 0: Baseline Assessment (Week 0)

Same core tests, but with more time to execute them properly across 2-3 sessions:

### Session 1: Strength Tests

- Finger max strength (7-second max hang, 20-22mm edge)
- Weighted pull-up 3-5RM test
- Upper body power proxy (campus max reach if safe, or standardized dyno test)

### Session 2: Endurance Tests

- Intermittent hang test (60% MVC, 7:2 work:rest)
- Benchmark power-endurance route/circuit (2-3 min duration)
- Optional: 30-second all-out finger test (if equipment available)

### Session 3: Performance Baseline

- Limit boulder session (track max grade, attempts-to-send)
- Current project route assessment
- Movement efficiency notes

### Injury Screen (Throughout)

- Finger pain ratings (0-10 each finger)
- Morning stiffness tracking
- Shoulder/elbow comfort
- Any existing tweaks or chronic issues

------

## Training Structure Overview

**Key Advantage:** With 4 days/week, we can separate high-intensity stimuli properly, allowing each session to have a focused target while maintaining quality throughout the week.

**Mesocycle 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Strength Foundation + Aerobic Base
 **Mesocycle 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Power-Endurance Development
 **Mesocycle 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Route-Specific Performance + Taper

**Training Frequency:** 4 sessions per week
 **Optimal Schedule:** Mon/Tue + Thu/Fri (allows 2-day weekend recovery)
 **Alternative:** Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat (more evenly distributed)

**Session Duration:** 60-90 minutes (more focused than 2-day plan since stimuli are separated)

------

## Mesocycle 1: Strength Foundation + Base (Weeks 1-4)

### Goals

- Build maximum finger strength (primary limiter for short power routes)
- Establish aerobic base for inter-move recovery
- Develop movement efficiency
- Create tissue tolerance for harder training ahead

## Modified Progression Rules (4-Day Specific)

### For Max Hangs (Session 1):

**Weeks 1-4:**

- If all 6 sets × 10 sec completed for 2 consecutive sessions → add 2.5-5% load
- Progress conservatively given high weekly volume

**Weeks 5-8:**

- Maintain loads from Week 3-4
- Goal: Zero regression while PE work intensifies

**Weeks 9-12:**

- Reduce to 2-3 sets
- Maintain same loads (or reduce 5-10% if needed for freshness)

### For Pull-ups (Session 2):

- Add 2.5-5 lbs when you can complete 5 reps on all sets
- Focus on form quality over absolute load

### For PE Intervals (Session 2):

**Progression hierarchy (change ONE per week):**

1. Add rounds (volume first)
2. Reduce rest periods (10-15 sec reduction)
3. Increase difficulty (steeper/smaller holds)
4. Add sets (only in Week 6-7)

**Example progression:**

- Week 5: 3 sets × 6 rounds, 60s/90s
- Week 6: 3 sets × 7 rounds, 60s/90s (volume +)
- Week 7: 3 sets × 7 rounds, 60s/75s (rest -)
- Week 9-10: 1-2 sets × 4-5 rounds (taper)

### For Route Work (Session 4):

- Quality over quantity always
- Track high points weekly
- Celebrate incremental progress
- Don't force sends on tired days

------

## Recovery Optimization (4-Day Plan)

**Tuesday → Thursday (48 hours):**

- Challenge: Recover from hardest session
- Wednesday: Complete rest or very light activity
- Nutrition: High protein, adequate calories
- Sleep: 7-9 hours both nights
- Mobility: Foam rolling, stretching
- Mental: Process video from Tuesday

**Thursday → Friday (24 hours):**

- Challenge: Be fresh for performance
- Thursday should feel EASY
- Sleep: Prioritize quality over quantity
- Nutrition: Dial in timing for Friday

## Comparing 4-Day to 2-Day and 3-Day Plans

### What 4 Days Gives You vs 3 Days:

**Advantages:** ✅ Better separation of stimuli (strength vs PE vs skill vs performance)
 ✅ Higher total weekly volume (+30-40% more climbing)
 ✅ More practice opportunities for route-specific skills
 ✅ Faster adaptation and progression
 ✅ Can sustain higher intensity per session
 ✅ Greater variety (less boredom)

**Challenges:** ❌ Requires excellent recovery discipline
 ❌ More time commitment (6-8 hrs/week vs 4-5)
 ❌ Higher injury risk if not managed properly
 ❌ Less life flexibility
 ❌ Can be mentally fatiguing

**Expected Outcomes (4-day vs 3-day):**

- Max hang improvement: 8-15% vs 5-12%
- Route grade progression: 1-2 grades vs 1 grade
- Time to goal: 10-12 weeks vs 12-14 weeks

### What 4 Days Gives You vs 2 Days:

**Advantages:** ✅ MUCH higher total volume (100%+ more)
 ✅ Can separate conflicting stimuli properly
 ✅ Significantly faster progression
 ✅ More opportunities to practice skills
 ✅ Better movement quality development
 ✅ Higher performance ceiling

**Trade-offs:** ❌ 2× time commitment
 ❌ Requires disciplined recovery
 ❌ Weekend must be protected for rest
 ❌ Less suitable for very busy schedules

**Expected Outcomes (4-day vs 2-day):**

- Max hang improvement: 8-15% vs 5-10%
- Route grade progression: 1-2 grades vs 1 grade
- Time to goal: 10-12 weeks vs 16-20 weeks
- Movement skill: Significantly better development

------

## 4-Day Plan: Who It's For

### Ideal Candidates:

- Intermediate-advanced climbers (V4/5.11+ baseline)
- Can commit 6-8 hours/week to training
- Have weekend recovery time available
- Want to progress relatively quickly
- Can manage recovery discipline
- Have access to gym 4 days/week
- No major injury history or managed well

### Not Ideal For:

- Complete beginners (too much stimulus)
- Very busy professionals (time commitment)
- Poor recovery capacity (need more rest days)
- Injury-prone (need more recovery time)
- Limited gym access (<4 days/week)

### Alternative Approaches:

**If 4 days feels like too much:**

- Start with 3-day plan for 8 weeks
- Add 4th day in Mesocycle 2 only
- Run 4-day plan but make Thursdays optional
- Reduce volume 20% across all sessions

**If 4 days feels manageable but you want more:**

- Add light 5th day (easy technique only) in Weeks 5-8
- Extend ARC sessions on Tuesday to 45-50 min
- Add optional core/antagonist session on Sunday
- Do NOT add more high-intensity work

------

## Sample Week-by-Week sRPE Targets

### Mesocycle 1 (Weeks 1-4):

- Week 1: 240-280 total sRPE
- Week 2: 260-300 total sRPE
- Week 3: 280-320 total sRPE
- Week 4: 140-180 total sRPE (deload)

### Mesocycle 2 (Weeks 5-8):

- Week 5: 280-320 total sRPE
- Week 6: 300-340 total sRPE
- Week 7: 320-360 total sRPE
- Week 8: 160-200 total sRPE (deload)

### Mesocycle 3 (Weeks 9-12):

- Week 9: 240-280 total sRPE
- Week 10: 220-260 total sRPE
- Week 11: 180-220 total sRPE
- Week 12: 100-140 total sRPE (taper)

*Note: Individual variance is high. Use these as guides, not rules. Adjust based on recovery.*

## Final Performance Expectations (4-Day Plan)

### Realistic 12-Week Outcomes:

**Physical Improvements:**

- Finger max strength: +8-15%
- Intermittent endurance: +25-45%
- Pull-up strength: +10-20%
- Power-endurance capacity: +40-60% total work volume
- Movement efficiency: Measurably improved

**Performance Outcomes:**

- Route grade progression: 1-2 letter grades (e.g., 5.11d → 5.12b/c)
- Send rate: Significantly improved at current grade
- Attempts-to-send: Reduced by 20-40%
- Confidence: Dramatically improved on sustained routes

**Subjective Benefits:**

- Better pump management
- More efficient movement
- Improved route reading
- Better pacing and tactics
- Greater mental resilience

### Why This 4-Day Plan Works

This plan applies the research from your document with optimal stimulus distribution:

1. **Separated stimuli** - Max strength, PE, skill, and performance each get dedicated days, preventing interference
2. **Adequate frequency** - 4 days allows enough practice for motor learning while maintaining recovery
3. **Progressive overload** - Clear weekly progression across all domains
4. **Deload discipline** - Weeks 4 and 8 prevent overuse injuries emphasized in your research
5. **Route specificity** - Friday performance sessions ensure transfer to actual climbing
6. **Testing integration** - Regular testing provides feedback and motivation

The 4-day structure is the "sweet spot" for most intermediate-advanced climbers: enough volume for rapid progress, enough rest to stay healthy, manageable time commitment.

**Your commitment with 4-day plan:** Be religious about recovery. The training is only as good as your ability to adapt to it.
