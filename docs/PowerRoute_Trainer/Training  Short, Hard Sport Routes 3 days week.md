# 12-Week Training Plan for Short, Hard Sport Routes



# Phase 0: Baseline Assessment (Week 0)

Before starting training, you need to establish measurable baselines. Schedule these tests across 2-3 sessions with full rest between:

### Required Tests

**1. Finger Max Strength (7-second max hang)**

- Edge: 20-22mm, half-crimp grip
- Protocol: Progressive loading until you find your max weight for a strict 7-second hang
- Rest: 2 minutes between attempts
- Record: Total load (bodyweight + added weight) in kg

**2. Finger Endurance (Intermittent hang test)**

- Load: 60% of your max hang weight (from test above)
- Protocol: 7 seconds on, 2 seconds off, repeat until failure
- Failure = can't maintain force or form breaks down
- Record: Total repetitions completed

**3. Power-Endurance Benchmark Route/Circuit**

- Find a steep route or circuit that takes 2-3 minutes of continuous climbing
- Climb it once at high intensity (RPE 8-9)
- Record: Time to completion, number of rests/shakes, subjective pump rating (1-10)

**4. Baseline Injury Screen**

- Rate finger pain: 0-10 scale for each finger
- Note any existing tweaks, morning stiffness, or tender spots
- Record shoulder/elbow comfort levels

------

## Mesocycle 1: Strength + Aerobic Base (Weeks 1-4)

### Goals

- Build max finger strength to raise your ceiling
- Develop aerobic base for recovery between hard moves
- Establish movement efficiency habits

### Weekly Structure

**Session A (Monday): Max Hangs + Technique**

*Warm-up (15 min):*

   - Focus: Perfect shoulder engagement, no slipping
2. **Technical Bouldering** (30 min)
   - 5-8 easy-moderate problems focusing on footwork precision
   - Rest fully between attempts
   - Goal: Movement quality, not intensity

*Post-Session Tracking:*

- Log all 6 hang loads (did you complete 10s each time?)
- Rate finger comfort 0-10
- Note any form breakdown

------

**Session B (Wednesday): Easy Mileage + Antagonist Work**

2. **Route Practice - Variety** (45 min)
   - Climb 4-6 routes across different styles
   - Mix: vertical technical, overhanging endurance, short powerful
   - Rest: 8-10 minutes between quality attempts
   - Focus: Reading, pacing, shake efficiency

*Post-Session Tracking:*

- Pull-up loads used
- Routes completed (grades/styles)
- Quality of movement (1-5 rating)

------

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Reduce total volume by 50%:**

- Session A: 3 sets of max hangs instead of 6
- Session B: 15 minutes ARC instead of 30
- Session C: Skip weighted pulls, easy routes only

**Retest (end of Week 4):**

- 7-second max hang (should see 3-8% improvement)
- Intermittent endurance test (should see more reps)
- Log changes and reassess form

------

## Mesocycle 2: Power-Endurance Build (Weeks 5-8)

### Goals

- Develop ability to repeat hard sequences with incomplete recovery
- Train the "pump management" zone
- Maintain max strength

### Weekly Structure

**Session A (Monday): Power-Endurance Intervals**

*Main Work:*

1. **Short Route Intervals** (Main stimulus)
   - **Week 5-6:** 6 rounds × 60 seconds on / 90 seconds rest
   - **Week 7:** 8 rounds × 60 seconds on / 75 seconds rest
   - Intensity: Hard enough that last 5 reps feel RPE 8-9
   - Use: Steep circuit or short route sections
   - Rest between sets: 10 minutes (do 2-3 total sets)

*Post-Session Tracking:*

- Total intervals completed at target intensity
- Which interval started feeling hard?
- Pump rating at end of each set (1-10)
- Session RPE (0-10) × duration = sRPE load

------

**Session B (Wednesday): Max Hangs Maintenance + Easy Volume**

*Main Work:*

1. **Max Hangs** (4 sets × 10 seconds)
   - Same load as Week 3 (not progressing during PE focus)
   - Goal: Maintain strength ceiling

## Progression Rules (Critical for Safety)

**For Max Hangs:**

- If you complete all 6 sets × 10 seconds for 2 consecutive sessions → add 2.5-5% load
- If you fail a set → repeat same load next session
- If finger pain >3/10 during or after → reduce load by 10%

**For Intervals:**

- Progress volume first (add 1-2 reps per week)
- Then reduce rest (decrease by 10-15 seconds)
- Then increase difficulty (steeper/smaller holds)
- **Only change ONE variable per week**

**Stop Criteria (Non-Negotiable):**

- Sharp pain or "pop" in finger → STOP, evaluate injury
- Pain increasing during session → end session early
- Next-morning stiffness >6/10 → skip next session or go very easy
- Skin splits/bleeding → reduce volume until healed

------

## Expected Outcomes After 12 Weeks

Based on research cited in your document:

**Strength:** 5-15% improvement in max hang
 **Endurance:** 20-40% more reps on intermittent test
 **Performance:** 1-2 grade progression on short power routes (individual results vary)
 **Injury Risk:** Significantly reduced if you follow deload and stop criteria

------

## Why This Works

This plan directly applies the research in your document:

1. **Finger strength is the foundation** - max hangs anchor Weeks 1-4 because finger-flexor strength correlates strongly with climbing performance
2. **Specificity matters** - Weeks 5-8 shift to power-endurance intervals because your goal is *short hard routes*, matching the 1-3 minute effort domain
3. **Progressive overload** - small weekly increases in volume/intensity within each mesocycle
4. **Deloads are mandatory** - Week 4 and Week 8 reduce overuse injury risk, which your document emphasizes repeatedly for finger/pulley injuries
5. **Testing creates feedback** - measurements every 4 weeks let you adjust if something isn't working

The 3-session structure allows adequate recovery, while still providing enough stimulus for adaptation.
