# 12-Week Training Plan for Long Endurance Route Performance (4 Days/Week)

This plan leverages 4 training days per week to provide optimal stimulus distribution for long-route endurance development. The additional frequency allows separation of training stresses, higher total volume, more varied stimulus, and better recovery management compared to 2-3 day plans—while still respecting the injury-prevention principles the research emphasizes.

## Pre-Training Assessment (Week 0)

The assessment remains identical:

### Required Tests

1. **Finger Max Strength Test**
   - 7-second max hang on 20–22mm edge, half-crimp grip
   - Progressive warm-up, 2-minute rest between attempts
   - Record maximum load (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)
2. **Intermittent Finger Endurance Test**
   - 7 seconds on / 2 seconds off at 60% of max hang load
   - Record total repetitions to failure
3. **ARC Benchmark**
   - Continuous easy climbing at "light pump" intensity
   - Record total time and perceived pump level (1–10)
4. **Technique/Efficiency Proxy**
   - Standard circuit: record time, shakeouts, unplanned stops
   - Optional video review for movement quality
5. **Injury Risk Baseline**
   - Finger pain check (especially pulleys)
   - Elbow/shoulder discomfort assessment
   - Morning stiffness levels

------

## The 12-Week Program Structure

Same mesocycle framework:

- **Weeks 1–3:** Aerobic base + technique development
- **Week 4:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 5–7:** Volume build (longer continuous efforts)
- **Week 8:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 9–11:** Specific endurance + route tactics
- **Week 12:** Taper + performance week

------

## Weekly Schedule (4 Workouts/Week)

With 4 sessions, you can separate training stresses more effectively, allowing each session to target specific adaptations while managing fatigue. The research supports this approach through established resistance training principles emphasizing adequate rest between high-intensity sessions.

### Standard Week Layout

| Day           | Activity                                        | Primary Focus        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Monday**    | Workout A: Primary endurance (ARC/long work)    | Aerobic capacity     |
| Tuesday       | Rest                                            | Recovery             |
| **Wednesday** | Workout B: Strength + power maintenance         | Max strength ceiling |
| Thursday      | Rest                                            | Recovery             |
| **Friday**    | Workout C: Intervals/moderate intensity         | Threshold work       |
| Saturday      | Rest or optional easy climbing (<30 min social) | Active recovery      |
| **Sunday**    | Workout D: Route practice + technique           | Specificity & skills |

**Why this structure works:**

- Separates high-finger-load days (Mon, Wed) with rest days to manage tendon/pulley stress
- Places intervals (Fri) after recovery, before technique day (Sun)
- Sunday technique work uses accumulated week fatigue to simulate late-route conditions
- Research emphasizes load management as critical for injury prevention; this spacing optimizes recovery

------

## Mesocycle 1: Aerobic Base + Technique (Weeks 1–4)

This block establishes the aerobic foundation and movement efficiency essential for long routes.

### **Workout A (Monday): ARC-Style Continuous Climbing**

**What you'll do:**

- Continuous easy climbing for 20–35 minutes
- Very low intensity: conversational pace, light pump only
- Use traversing, up-down routes, or easy laps
- Focus on smooth, relaxed movement and steady breathing

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 20 minutes continuous
- Week 2: 25 minutes continuous
- Week 3: 30–35 minutes continuous
- Week 4 (deload): 15 minutes continuous

**What to track after each session:**

- Total time climbed
- Perceived pump level at end (1–10 scale)
- Movement quality notes (smooth? relaxed? overgripping anywhere?)
- Session RPE (0–10, rated 30 minutes after finishing)
- Calculate sRPE: Duration (min) × RPE
- Next-day finger/forearm feeling

**Why Monday:** Starting the week with low-intensity aerobic work allows you to begin fresh while setting an endurance foundation that supports the rest of the week's training.

------

### **Workout B (Wednesday): Max Hangs + Pulling Strength**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Max Hangs (primary focus)*

- 6 repetitions × 10 seconds at 85–95% of your max hang
- 20–22mm edge, half-crimp grip, strict scapular position
- 2 minutes rest between reps
- Stop immediately if any finger pain

*Part 2: Upper-Body Pulling Strength*

- Weighted pull-ups: 3 sets × 3–5 reps at heavy load
- OR: Assisted one-arm hangs/pulls: 3 sets × 3–5 reps each side
- 3 minutes rest between sets
- Focus on control and full range of motion

*Part 3: Antagonist Work (10 minutes)*

- Push-ups or dips: 2 sets × 8–12 reps
- Shoulder external rotation: 2 sets × 12–15 reps light band
- Wrist extensors: 2 sets × 15 reps

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 6 hangs @ 85% + 3 sets pulls + antagonists
- Week 2: 6 hangs @ 90% + 3 sets pulls + antagonists
- Week 3: 6 hangs @ 90–95% + 3 sets pulls + antagonists
- Week 4 (deload): 4 hangs @ 85%, skip pulls, light antagonists only

**What to track:**

- Max hang load used each rep
- Any finger discomfort (0–10 scale) during or after
- Pull-up load/assistance level
- Form quality notes
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms (especially finger stiffness)

**Why this works:** The research shows that maximal finger strength is a key performance determinant even for endurance climbing, because it keeps holds at a lower percentage of maximum, delaying fatigue. Wednesday placement allows recovery from Monday's volume while giving 2 days before Friday's intervals. The antagonist work addresses common injury sites emphasized in the overuse injury literature.

------

### **Workout C (Friday): Moderate Continuous Laps**

**What you'll do:**

- 3–6 laps on a moderate circuit (10–15 moves per lap)
- Difficulty: manageable but creates accumulating pump
- Rest 3–5 minutes between laps
- Focus: efficient movement, identifying good shakeout positions, breathing rhythm, pacing

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 3 laps (rest 4 min)
- Week 2: 4 laps (rest 4 min)
- Week 3: 5–6 laps (rest 3–4 min)
- Week 4 (deload): 2 laps (rest 5 min)

**What to track:**

- Number of laps completed
- Pump level after each lap (1–10 scale)
- Rest time between laps
- Movement quality observations (where did you overgrip? rush? find good positions?)
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why Friday:** This moderate-intensity work comes after recovery from Wednesday's strength session and before Sunday's technique focus. It builds time-on-wall at accumulating intensity, training the specific forearm endurance demands the research identifies for lead climbing.

------

### **Workout D (Sunday): Route Mileage + Technique Focus**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Varied Route Practice (main focus)*

- 4–6 routes at comfortable redpoint level
- Mix styles: vertical, overhanging, technical, sustained
- Focus areas: reading sequences before climbing, identifying rest positions, efficient clipping, pacing awareness

*Part 2: Specific Technique Drills (15 minutes)*

- Choose based on your weaknesses:
  - Silent feet practice
  - Rest position holds (practice shaking out efficiently)
  - Downclimbing for movement reversibility
  - Clipping efficiency drills

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 4 routes + 1 drill type
- Week 2: 5 routes + 2 drill types
- Week 3: 6 routes + 2 drill types
- Week 4 (deload): 2–3 easy routes, fun climbing only

**What to track:**

- Routes climbed (grade, style, length)
- Specific technique observations (what improved? what needs work?)
- Energy levels (are you fresh or carrying fatigue from the week?)
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Overall week feeling (recovery quality)

**Why Sunday:** End-of-week placement means you're climbing with accumulated fatigue, simulating real long-route conditions where technique and tactics matter most when you're tired. The research emphasizes that on-wall training improves technique measures, making this dedicated skill work valuable. Sunday also sets you up for Monday's fresh aerobic session.

------

### **Week 4: Deload + Testing**

**Monday:** 15-minute ARC only

**Wednesday:** Retest max hang (7s protocol)

- Also retest weighted pull-up 3–5RM if tracking

**Friday:** Retest intermittent finger endurance (7s on/2s off at 60% MVC)

**Sunday:** Retest ARC benchmark + light technique climbing

**What to track:**

- All test results vs. baseline
- How tests felt (easier/harder/same perceived effort?)
- Overall fatigue and recovery quality through deload week
- Any developing pain or injury symptoms
- Weekly sRPE comparison to Weeks 1–3

**Expected outcomes:** You should see improvements in both endurance metrics (ARC time, intermittent reps) and strength metrics (max hang load). The 4-day structure allows enough total stimulus to drive adaptation across multiple qualities simultaneously.

------

## Mesocycle 2: Volume Build (Weeks 5–8)

This block significantly increases total climbing volume and introduces longer sustained efforts while maintaining strength.

### **Workout A (Monday): Extended ARC Sessions**

**What you'll do:**

- Continuous easy climbing for 30–50 minutes
- Maintain very low intensity (light pump throughout)
- Can break into 2 sets if needed: e.g., 25 min + 5 min rest + 20 min
- Focus on movement economy, breathing, finding flow

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 30–35 minutes
- Week 6: 40 minutes
- Week 7: 45–50 minutes
- Week 8 (deload): 20 minutes

**What to track:**

- Total time, perceived pump level
- Split times if broken into sets
- Movement efficiency observations (getting smoother at longer durations?)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms
- Weekly volume trend (compare total weekly sRPE across mesocycles)

**Why this matters:** The research shows forearm aerobic capacity is crucial for long routes. These extended sessions specifically develop capillary density and mitochondrial adaptations in forearm musculature, improving your ability to sustain work and recover during shakeouts.

------

### **Workout B (Wednesday): Max Hangs + Pulling Strength (Maintained)**

**What you'll do:**

*Same structure as Mesocycle 1, with possible load increases:*

- 6 reps × 10s at 85–95% (progress load if Week 3 was clean)
- Weighted pull-ups: 3 sets × 3–5 reps
- Antagonist work: maintained

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: Attempt +2–5% load on hangs if ready
- Week 6: Stabilize new load
- Week 7: Another +2–5% if form is perfect and pain-free
- Week 8 (deload): 4 hangs @ 85%, skip pulls, light antagonists

**What to track:**

- Max hang load progression
- Pull-up load progression
- Form quality and finger comfort
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Progression rule (from research-aligned protocols):** Only increase load if you completed all 6 reps with strict form and zero pain on two consecutive sessions. Use small increments (2–5%) because finger tissue adaptations are slower than muscle. The research emphasizes conservative progression for injury prevention.

------

### **Workout C (Friday): Long Intervals ("Steady Hard")**

This becomes the primary capacity-building session, using longer efforts that accumulate substantial fatigue.

**What you'll do:**

- 3–5 intervals × 6–10 minutes continuous climbing
- Intensity: challenging but sustainable (can complete without falling)
- Rest: 4–6 minutes between intervals
- Focus: steady pacing, finding mid-interval recovery positions, breathing control

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 3 × 6 minutes (rest 5 min)
- Week 6: 4 × 6 minutes (rest 5 min)
- Week 7: 4 × 8 minutes (rest 5–6 min)
- Week 8 (deload): 2 × 6 minutes (rest 6 min)

**What to track:**

- Total work time completed (e.g., 4 × 8 min = 32 min total work)
- Pump level after each interval (1–10 scale)
- Recovery quality between intervals (was rest time sufficient?)
- Pacing observations (did you start too hard? maintain steady effort?)
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** The finger flexor energetics research shows that intermittent endurance work has substantial aerobic contribution while also developing anaerobic capacity. These intervals sit in the intensity domain directly relevant to multi-minute lead climbing efforts.

------

### **Workout D (Sunday): Route Practice + Volume**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Mixed Route Mileage (primary focus)*

- 6–8 routes of varying styles and lengths
- Include some longer routes (sustained 4–6+ minute efforts)
- Emphasis on maintaining efficiency when fatigued

*Part 2: Technical Practice (15 minutes)*

- Specific skill work based on identified weaknesses
- Examples: rest optimization, clipping rhythm, reading sequences efficiently

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 6 routes (mix of lengths)
- Week 6: 7 routes (include 2 longer efforts)
- Week 7: 7–8 routes (include 3 longer efforts)
- Week 8 (deload): 3–4 easy routes, low key

**What to track:**

- Routes climbed (styles, lengths, performance notes)
- Fatigue management through the session
- Technical insights gained
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Recovery quality (end of week assessment)

**Why Sunday:** End-of-week placement means maximum accumulated fatigue, perfectly simulating the late-route conditions where technique and tactics become most important. This is specific preparation for executing efficiently when tired.

------

### **Week 8: Deload + Testing**

**Monday:** 20-minute ARC only

**Wednesday:** Retest max hang + optional pull-up check

**Friday:** Retest intermittent endurance + optional critical force test if you have equipment

**Sunday:** Retest ARC benchmark + light technique

**What to track:**

- Test results vs. Week 4 and baseline
- Weekly sRPE totals for Weeks 5–7 (monitor progressive overload)
- Symptom trends (any developing issues?)
- Recovery quality through deload week

**Expected outcomes:** Further improvements across all metrics. Your sustained work capacity should be notably better, max strength should be maintained or improved, and ARC time should show significant gains over baseline.

------

## Mesocycle 3: Specific Endurance + Route Tactics (Weeks 9–12)

The final block emphasizes route-specific execution, integrating your developed physical capacities with tactical and technical skills.

### **Workout A (Monday): Long Route Simulations**

This becomes your primary performance-building session, directly mimicking target route demands.

**What you'll do:**

- 2–4 attempts at routes or combinations lasting 6–12+ minutes
- Full attention to: pacing strategy, shakeout efficiency, clipping rhythm, reading ahead, managing pump
- 15–20 minute rest between attempts (full recovery for quality)
- Treat like redpoint attempts: maximum effort, maximum focus

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 3 attempts at 6–8 minute routes
- Week 10: 3–4 attempts at 8–10 minute routes
- Week 11: 2–3 attempts at target route length/style
- Week 12 (taper): 1 high-quality attempt only

**What to track:**

- Route/simulation length and time
- Number and quality of shakeouts taken
- Where and when fatigue hit hardest
- Pacing observations (start too fast? maintain steady? manage pump well?)
- Strategic insights (what worked? what needs adjustment?)
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day recovery quality

**Why Monday:** Fresh start to the week allows maximum quality for these performance simulations. The research emphasizes that climbing performance integrates physiology with technique and tactics—this session is where everything comes together.

------

### **Workout B (Wednesday): Strength Maintenance (Reduced Volume)**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Reduced Max Hangs*

- Weeks 9–10: 4 reps × 10s at 85–90%
- Week 11: 2 reps × 10s at 85–90%
- Week 12: Skip entirely (taper)

*Part 2: Maintenance Pulling*

- Weeks 9–10: 2 sets × 3–5 reps weighted pull-ups
- Week 11: 1 set × 3–5 reps
- Week 12: Skip entirely

*Part 3: Antagonist Work (maintained)*

- Consistent 2 sets each: push, external rotation, wrist extensors
- Week 12: Light only

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Progressive volume reduction while maintaining intensity
- Keeps strength ceiling from dropping during specificity phase

**What to track:**

- Hang load (should remain stable despite reduced volume)
- Pull-up load (should remain stable)
- Finger comfort and recovery
- Session RPE/sRPE (should be declining)

**Why reduced volume:** The research shows minimal effective dose can maintain strength adaptations. You're reducing volume to manage cumulative fatigue while keeping intensity high enough to prevent detraining. This allows more energy for route-specific work.

------

### **Workout C (Friday): Mixed Intensity + Tactics**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Moderate Volume Climbing (20–30 minutes)*

- Varied intensity and styles: some easy continuous, some moderate intervals
- Mix vertical, overhanging, technical terrain
- Focus on efficiency across different contexts

*Part 2: Specific Tactic Practice (15–20 minutes)*

- Work on weaknesses identified in Monday's simulations
- Examples:
  - Rest position practice (shake efficiency)
  - Clipping drill (speed and energy cost)
  - Pacing control (metronome or timed sections)
  - Reading efficiency (limit preview time, improve accuracy)

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 25 min mixed + full tactic practice
- Week 10: 30 min mixed + full tactic practice
- Week 11: 20 min mixed + targeted tactics only
- Week 12 (taper): 15 min easy climbing, no drills

**What to track:**

- Total time and intensity distribution
- Specific skill improvements noted
- Energy levels (fresh or carrying fatigue?)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this session:** Maintains general climbing volume and fitness while allowing targeted skill refinement. The moderate intensity and tactic work support your performance goals without accumulating excessive fatigue.

------

### **Workout D (Sunday): Route Practice + Integration**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Target Route Attempts (primary focus)*

- Work your actual long route goal, or closest simulation
- 2–3 full attempts with maximum rest between (20+ min)
- Apply all learned tactics: pacing, rest optimization, clipping efficiency
- Quality over quantity: no junk volume

*Part 2: Recovery Climbing (if energy permits)*

- Very easy routes (well below your level)
- Focus on movement enjoyment and flow
- 10–15 minutes maximum

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 2–3 attempts on goal-style routes
- Week 10: 2–3 attempts, refining tactics based on Monday learnings
- Week 11: 2 high-quality attempts (reducing volume)
- Week 12 (taper): 1 attempt or rest entirely

**What to track:**

- Route performance and progress
- Execution quality of tactics
- Comparison to Monday simulation sessions
- Strategic insights and adjustments needed
- Session RPE/sRPE
- End-of-week recovery assessment

**Why Sunday:** Second route-specific session in the week provides additional practice volume for skill integration. End-of-week placement means you're practicing execution under accumulated fatigue—exactly what happens late in a long route.

------

### **Week 12: Taper + Performance**

The taper reduces volume substantially while maintaining minimal intensity to preserve adaptations.

**Monday:** 15-minute easy ARC + 1 light route simulation (40–50% intensity)

**Wednesday:** Skip or very light antagonist work only

**Friday:** 10–15 minutes easy climbing, movement drills only

**Sunday:** Final performance attempt on target long route

- Full rest beforehand (20+ minutes)
- Maximum quality, apply all tactics
- Peak performance window

**Additional attempts:** Monday/Wednesday of following week if needed

**What to track:**

- Final performance outcome
- Felt difficulty vs. earlier attempts in training
- Overall 12-week progress across all metrics
- Lessons learned and future training adjustments

## Weekly Volume and Load Management

### Sample Weekly sRPE Progression (Mesocycle 2 Example)

| Week | Workout A        | Workout B           | Workout C        | Workout D        | **Total Weekly sRPE** | Notes               |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 5    | 210 (35 min × 6) | 180 (45 min × 4)    | 240 (40 min × 6) | 280 (40 min × 7) | **910**               | Volume build begins |
| 6    | 280 (40 min × 7) | 195 (45 min × 4.3)  | 300 (50 min × 6) | 336 (48 min × 7) | **1111**              | +22% from Week 5    |
| 7    | 336 (48 min × 7) | 204 (48 min × 4.25) | 384 (64 min × 6) | 392 (56 min × 7) | **1316**              | +18% from Week 6    |
| 8    | 120 (20 min × 6) | 108 (36 min × 3)    | 84 (21 min × 4)  | 120 (30 min × 4) | **432**               | Deload: -67%        |

**Key monitoring principle:** The research emphasizes that load management is a modifiable injury-risk factor. Track weekly sRPE totals and watch for:

- Week-to-week increases >20–30% (high injury risk)
- Monotony: similar RPE every session (increases overuse risk)
- Strain: high load + low variability over multiple weeks

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

| Symptom                           | Threshold                                       | Action Required                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Finger pain during session**    | >3/10 or any sharp pain                         | Stop finger intensity immediately; switch to easy technique/endurance only |
| **Next-morning finger stiffness** | Increasing trend over 2+ sessions               | Reduce total finger-load volume next week by 30–40%          |
| **sRPE monotony**                 | All sessions 7+ for 2 weeks                     | Insert deload week immediately                               |
| **Persistent fatigue**            | Not recovering within 48 hours between sessions | Add extra rest day or reduce session volume by 25%           |
| **Skin deterioration**            | Frequent splits, flappers                       | Reduce abrasive volume; prioritize quality over quantity     |
| **Declining motivation**          | Dreading sessions 3+ consecutive times          | Take 3–5 days complete rest; reassess goals and plan         |

------

## Advantages of 4-Day Structure (vs. 2-Day and 3-Day Plans)

### Volume Capacity

**Total weekly volume comparison at peak (Week 7):**

- 2-day plan: ~100–120 minutes/week total
- 3-day plan: ~140–180 minutes/week total
- **4-day plan: ~180–220 minutes/week total**

**Why this matters:** More volume allows more total stimulus across different training qualities (aerobic, strength, intervals, technique), potentially leading to faster and more complete adaptations.

### Stimulus Separation

**With 4 days, you can properly separate:**

1. Pure aerobic work (low stress, high volume)
2. Max strength work (high neural demand, low volume)
3. Interval/threshold work (high metabolic stress)
4. Technical/specific work (skill practice under fatigue)

**Research support:** Resistance training principles emphasize adequate recovery between high-intensity sessions. The 4-day structure allows 1–2 rest days between finger-intense sessions, optimizing tissue recovery while maintaining training frequency.

### Injury Risk Management

**Paradoxically, 4 days may have LOWER injury risk than 3 days:**

- Better separation of finger-loading sessions
- Lower per-session volume (spread across more days)
- More opportunities to monitor symptoms and adjust
- Can reduce a single session without derailing the week

**Research basis:** The overuse injury literature emphasizes load management and recovery as modifiable risk factors. The 4-day structure optimizes both.

### Adaptation Quality

**Multiple training qualities can improve simultaneously:**

- Max strength can actually increase (not just maintain)
- Aerobic capacity develops more fully (more low-intensity volume)
- Technique refinement gets dedicated time
- Interval capacity can be pushed harder (better recovered)

**Expected outcomes comparison:**

### Flexibility and Resilience

**With 4 sessions, you have options:**

- Miss one session? Still get 3 quality days
- Feeling beat up? Can reduce one session without losing all stimulus
- Need to adjust? Multiple points to modulate volume/intensity
- Travel or life disruption? Can maintain 2-3 days and minimize detraining

## Progression Principles (4-Day Specific)

### How to Progress Within Mesocycles

**General rule: Progress ONE variable at a time, one workout per week maximum**

**Week-to-week progression options:**

1. **Duration** (most common for endurance): Add 5 minutes to ARC or intervals
2. **Volume** (reps/sets): Add 1 lap, 1 interval, 1 route attempt
3. **Intensity** (load/difficulty): Increase hang load 2–5%, harder terrain
4. **Density** (reduce rest): Decrease rest between intervals by 30–60s

**Example progression sequence (Weeks 5–7):**

- Week 5: Increase duration (ARC 30→35 min)
- Week 6: Increase volume (intervals 3→4 sets) + increase duration (ARC 35→40 min)
- Week 7: Increase intensity slightly (harder interval terrain) + increase duration (ARC 40→45 min)
- Week 8: DELOAD (reduce all variables)

**Critical rule from injury literature:** Never increase multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., don't add volume AND intensity in the same week). This is where overuse injuries commonly originate.

### When to Progress vs. Stabilize

**Progress when:**

- Completed all target work cleanly for 2 consecutive sessions
- RPE for the work is 1–2 points lower than previous week
- Zero pain signals
- Good recovery within 48 hours
- Positive motivation and energy

**Stabilize (repeat same load/volume) when:**

- Work feels challenging but manageable
- Any minor discomfort (1–2/10 pain)
- Moderate fatigue between sessions
- Uncertain about form quality

**Regress (reduce load/volume) when:**

- Pain >2/10 during or after session
- Form deteriorating across session
- Not recovering fully between sessions
- Declining motivation or persistent fatigue

### Deload Execution (Every 4th Week)

**Volume reduction: 40–60% across all sessions**

- ARC: Reduce time by 40–50%
- Hangs: Reduce sets (6→4 reps) OR skip one session
- Intervals: Reduce sets (4→2) AND slightly reduce duration
- Routes: Reduce number (6→3) and keep easy

**Intensity: Maintain or slightly reduce**

- Keep hang load at similar % (maybe 85% instead of 95%)
- Keep interval terrain similar (don't go easier unless needed)
- Rationale: Maintains adaptations while allowing recovery

**Testing integrated into deload:**

- Replaces one workout with formal testing
- Testing itself provides minimal stimulus
- Gives objective progress feedback

## Special Considerations for 4-Day Training

### Recovery Monitoring Is Critical

**With higher weekly volume, you MUST monitor recovery:**

**Daily morning check (30 seconds):**

1. Finger feel: stiff/painful/normal? (0–10 scale)
2. Energy level: tired/normal/fresh? (1–10 scale)
3. Motivation: dreading/neutral/excited? (1–10 scale)

**If 2+ days show concerning trends:**

- Finger discomfort trend increasing → reduce finger load next session
- Energy consistently low → add extra rest day
- Motivation declining → reduce volume or take 2–3 days off

**Research basis:** The training load literature shows that monitoring internal load (how you feel) often predicts overtraining better than external load (what you did). Session-RPE captures this, but daily brief checks add sensitivity.

### Nutrition and Sleep Become More Important

**With 4 training days, recovery quality matters more:**

**Minimum standards for adaptation:**

- 7–9 hours sleep most nights (especially after high-intensity days)
- Adequate protein: ~1.6–2.2 g/kg bodyweight daily for tissue repair
- Sufficient carbohydrate: fuel for repeated sessions
- Hydration: especially important for tendon health

**This isn't optional:** The research shows recovery capacity influences adaptation. Poor sleep/nutrition limits how much training you can absorb, increasing injury risk and limiting performance gains.

### Week Planning Template

**Plan your intensity distribution across the week:**

| Day  | Primary Stress          | Intensity Level | Volume Level | RPE Target |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Mon  | Metabolic (aerobic)     | Low             | High         | 5–7        |
| Wed  | Mechanical (strength)   | High            | Low          | 4–6        |
| Fri  | Metabolic (intervals)   | Medium-High     | Medium       | 6–8        |
| Sun  | Technical (specificity) | Medium          | Medium-High  | 6–7        |

**Goal: Vary the stress type to allow targeted recovery while maintaining frequency**

## Sample 4-Week Mesocycle Detail (Mesocycle 2, Weeks 5–8)

### Week 5: Volume Build Initiation

**Monday:** ARC 35 min → RPE 6 → sRPE 210 **Wednesday:** 6 hangs @ +12kg, 3 sets pulls → RPE 4 → sRPE 180 **Friday:** 3 × 6 min intervals → RPE 6 → sRPE 240 **Sunday:** 6 routes mixed → RPE 7 → sRPE 280 **Weekly total:** 910 sRPE

### Week 6: Continue Building

**Monday:** ARC 40 min → RPE 7 → sRPE 280 (+33% from W5) **Wednesday:** 6 hangs @ +14kg, 3 sets pulls → RPE 4.3 → sRPE 195 (+8%) **Friday:** 4 × 6 min intervals → RPE 6 → sRPE 300 (+25%) **Sunday:** 7 routes mixed → RPE 7 → sRPE 336 (+20%) **Weekly total:** 1111 sRPE (+22% from W5)

**Check:** Is 22% weekly increase safe? Research suggests <20–30% is generally acceptable. Monitor symptoms closely.

### Week 7: Peak Loading

**Monday:** ARC 48 min → RPE 7 → sRPE 336 (+20%) **Wednesday:** 6 hangs @ +14kg, 3 sets pulls → RPE 4.25 → sRPE 204 (+5%) **Friday:** 4 × 8 min intervals → RPE 6 → sRPE 384 (+28%) **Sunday:** 8 routes mixed → RPE 7 → sRPE 392 (+17%) **Weekly total:** 1316 sRPE (+18% from W6)

**Note:** Week 7 shows high absolute load. Next week deload is MANDATORY, not optional.

### Week 8: Deload + Test

**Monday:** ARC 20 min → RPE 6 → sRPE 120 (-64%) **Wednesday:** 4 hangs @ +12kg, skip pulls → RPE 3 → sRPE 108 (-47%) **Friday:** Test intermittent endurance → RPE 4 → sRPE 84 **Sunday:** Test ARC + 3 easy routes → RPE 4 → sRPE 120 (-69%) **Weekly total:** 432 sRPE (-67% from W7)

**Purpose:** Dramatic volume reduction allows supercompensation. Testing provides objective progress check. You should feel fresh and recovered by end of week.

## Customization Options for 4-Day Plan

### If You Have Limited Time Per Session

**Reduce session duration but maintain frequency:**

- Monday: 30 min max (ARC only)
- Wednesday: 45 min max (hangs + pulls, skip antagonists or do at home)
- Friday: 40 min max (3 intervals instead of 4)
- Sunday: 50 min max (4–5 routes instead of 6–8)

**Total weekly volume is lower, but frequency is maintained, which can still drive good adaptations.**

### If You Have Access to Different Gym Types

**Optimize workout placement by gym:**

- Monday (ARC): Home wall, gym with good traversing
- Wednesday (strength): Gym with good hangboard/training area
- Friday (intervals): Gym with circuit-friendly terrain
- Sunday (routes): Crag or gym with many long routes

### If You're Coming Back from Injury

**Start with reduced intensity across all sessions:**

- Weeks 1–2: 60% of prescribed volume, RPE capped at 6
- Weeks 3–4: 75% of prescribed volume, RPE capped at 7
- Weeks 5–6: 90% of prescribed volume, normal RPE
- Weeks 7+: Full plan if symptom-free

**Monitor the injured area religiously with the symptom tracking system.**

### If You Want to Extend to 24 Weeks

**Option 1: Repeat the 12-week cycle with different emphasis**

- Cycle 1 (Weeks 1–12): Build aerobic base + maintain strength (as written)
- Cycle 2 (Weeks 13–24): Increase route specificity, reduce pure ARC, add more interval variety

**Option 2: Extend base-building phase**

- Weeks 1–8: Extended Mesocycle 1 (aerobic base + technique)
- Weeks 9–16: Extended Mesocycle 2 (volume build)
- Weeks 17–24: Extended Mesocycle 3 (specificity + performance)

**Research support:** Longer base phases can support better peak performance, especially for adult climbers who benefit from conservative progression and thorough adaptation periods.

## Why This 4-Day Plan Is Optimal for Long Route Endurance

### Evidence-Based Rationale Summary

1. **Sufficient volume for aerobic adaptations:** The research shows forearm aerobic capacity is critical for long routes. The 4-day structure allows 180–220+ minutes weekly climbing volume, enough to drive substantial capillary and mitochondrial adaptations.
2. **Separated training stresses:** High finger-load sessions (Mon ARC + Wed strength + Fri intervals) are spaced with rest days, respecting the injury literature's emphasis on recovery between loading bouts.
3. **Maintained strength ceiling:** Weekly max hang work (Wed) prevents strength from becoming the limiter, keeping holds at lower %MVC throughout long routes.
4. **Progressive overload properly applied:** Clear week-to-week progressions within mesocycles, followed by deload weeks, align with resistance training principles and injury prevention guidance.
5. **Technical integration under fatigue:** Sunday placement of technique work simulates late-route conditions where tactics and efficiency matter most.
6. **Monitoring systems built-in:** Session-RPE tracking, weekly symptom checks, and regular testing provide feedback loops essential for managing the multifactorial nature of climbing performance.
7. **Specificity progression:** The 12-week arc moves from general capacity → volume → specific execution, matching how climbing interventions are typically structured in the research.

**Bottom line:** If you can commit to 4 days/week, this plan provides optimal stimulus distribution for long-route endurance while managing injury risk and allowing comprehensive development across strength, endurance, and technical domains.
