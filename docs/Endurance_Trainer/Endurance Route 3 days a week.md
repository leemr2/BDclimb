# 12-Week Training Plan for Long Endurance Route Performance



## Pre-Training Assessment (Week 0)

Before starting, you need baseline measurements to track progress and set training intensities:

### Required Tests

1. **Finger Max Strength Test**
   - Perform a 7-second max hang on a 20–22mm edge using half-crimp grip
   - Warm up progressively, then test with 2-minute rests between attempts
   - Record your maximum load (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)
   - *Why this matters:* Even for endurance climbing, maintaining strength keeps holds at a lower percentage of your maximum, delaying fatigue
2. **Intermittent Finger Endurance Test**
   - After determining your max hang, calculate 60% of that load
   - Perform 7 seconds on / 2 seconds off repeats at 60% until failure
   - Record total repetitions completed before you can't maintain the target force
   - *Why this matters:* This correlates strongly with lead climbing performance and gives you a quantifiable endurance metric
3. **ARC Benchmark (Aerobic Capacity)**
   - Climb continuously on easy terrain for as long as possible while maintaining "light pump"
   - Stop when forearm discomfort reaches moderate levels (you should be able to talk normally throughout)
   - Record total time and perceived pump level (1–10 scale)
   - *Why this matters:* This establishes your current aerobic base for the sustained work long routes require
4. **Technique/Efficiency Proxy**
   - Choose a moderate circuit or route you can complete
   - Record: completion time, number of shakeouts taken, number of unplanned stops
   - Optionally video yourself to assess overgripping, inefficient positions, or poor pacing
   - *Why this matters:* Movement economy becomes increasingly important as route duration increases
5. **Injury Risk Baseline**
   - Check for any finger pain, especially around pulleys
   - Note any elbow or shoulder discomfort
   - Record morning stiffness levels
   - *Why this matters:* Overuse injuries are common in climbing; tracking symptoms helps you catch problems early

## The 12-Week Program Structure

The plan uses three 4-week mesocycles (training blocks), each with 3 weeks of progressive loading followed by 1 deload/testing week:

- **Weeks 1–3:** Aerobic base + technique development
- **Week 4:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 5–7:** Volume build (longer continuous climbing)
- **Week 8:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 9–11:** Specific endurance + route tactics
- **Week 12:** Taper + performance week

------

## Weekly Schedule (3 Workouts/Week)

Training 3 days per week provides adequate stimulus while allowing sufficient recovery—critical for avoiding overuse injuries that the research repeatedly identifies as a major risk in climbing.

### Standard Week Layout

| Day           | Activity                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Monday**    | Workout A: Primary endurance session             |
| Tuesday       | Rest or very light activity                      |
| **Wednesday** | Workout B: Secondary endurance/technique session |
| Thursday      | Rest                                             |
| **Friday**    | Workout C: Strength maintenance + route practice |
| Saturday      | Rest or optional easy climbing (social/fun)      |
| Sunday        | Rest                                             |

## Mesocycle 1: Aerobic Base + Technique (Weeks 1–4)

The research emphasizes that aerobic capacity and movement efficiency are crucial for long routes. This block builds that foundation.

### **Workout A: ARC-Style Continuous Climbing**

**What you'll do:**

- Climb continuously on easy terrain for 20–30 minutes
- Keep intensity very low—you should maintain conversation and experience only light pump
- Use traversing, up-down routes, or easy laps
- Focus on smooth, efficient movement

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 20 minutes continuous
- Week 2: 25 minutes continuous
- Week 3: 30 minutes continuous
- Week 4 (deload): 15 minutes continuous

**What to track after each session:**

- Total time climbed
- Perceived pump level at end (1–10 scale)
- Session RPE (0–10 scale, rated 30 minutes after finishing)
- Calculate session load: Duration (min) × RPE = sRPE
- Next-day finger/forearm feeling (any stiffness or pain?)

**Why this works:** The research shows that forearm aerobic capacity is a key determinant of long-route success. This low-intensity work develops capillary density and mitochondrial adaptations in your forearms without accumulating the fatigue that leads to overuse injuries.

------

### **Workout B: Moderate Continuous Laps**

**What you'll do:**

- Climb 3–5 laps on a moderate circuit (10–15 moves per lap)
- Choose difficulty where you can complete laps without falling but feel some accumulating pump
- Rest 3–5 minutes between laps
- Focus on efficient movement, good shakeout positions, and breathing

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 3 laps
- Week 2: 4 laps
- Week 3: 5 laps
- Week 4 (deload): 2 laps

**What to track:**

- Number of laps completed
- Rest time between laps
- Pump level after each lap (1–10)
- Movement quality notes (where did you overgrip? miss shakeouts? rush?)
- Session RPE and sRPE (duration × RPE)
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** This builds time-on-wall at moderate intensity, training your forearms to work under sustained load while giving you opportunities to practice pacing and recovery techniques essential for long routes.

------

### **Workout C: Strength Maintenance + Route Mileage**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Max Hangs (strength maintenance)*

- 4 total repetitions of 10-second hangs at 85–90% of your max
- Use 20–22mm edge, half-crimp grip
- 2 minutes rest between reps
- Stop immediately if you feel any finger pain

*Part 2: Varied Route Practice*

- Climb 3–5 routes of varying styles near your comfortable redpoint level
- Focus on: reading sequences before climbing, identifying rest positions, practicing efficient clipping

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Weeks 1–3: Same structure (maintain consistency)
- Week 4 (deload): Skip max hangs, climb 2 easy routes for fun

**What to track:**

- Max hang load used (should stay consistent across the mesocycle)
- Any finger discomfort during or after hangs (0–10 pain scale)
- Routes climbed (style, length, notes on performance)
- Session RPE and sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** The research shows that even in endurance-focused training, maintaining maximal finger strength prevents your strength ceiling from dropping. This makes holds on long routes feel easier (lower % of your maximum), delaying the onset of pump.

------

### **Week 4: Deload + Testing**

**Purpose:** Reduce accumulated fatigue while retesting to measure progress.

**Monday (Workout A):** 15-minute ARC session only

**Wednesday:** Retest intermittent finger endurance (7s on/2s off at 60% MVC)

- Record new repetition count
- Compare to baseline

**Friday:** Retest ARC benchmark

- Record new time and pump level
- Compare to baseline

**What to track:**

- Test results vs. baseline
- How you felt during tests (easier/harder/same perceived effort?)
- Overall fatigue and recovery quality through the week
- Any developing pain or injury symptoms

**Expected outcomes:** You should see improvements in endurance metrics (more reps, longer ARC time). If not, the deload gives your body extra recovery time before the next block.

------

## Mesocycle 2: Volume Build (Weeks 5–8)

This block increases total climbing volume and introduces longer continuous efforts to specifically develop the sustained work capacity long routes demand.

### **Workout A: Extended ARC Session**

**What you'll do:**

- Continuous easy climbing for 30–45 minutes
- Maintain very low intensity (light pump only)
- Can break into 2 sets if needed: 20 min + rest 5 min + 15 min

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 30 minutes
- Week 6: 35 minutes
- Week 7: 40–45 minutes
- Week 8 (deload): 20 minutes

**What to track:**

- Total time, perceived pump, session RPE/sRPE
- Movement efficiency observations (are you getting smoother?)
- Next-day symptoms
- Weekly volume trend (add up sRPE across all sessions each week)

------

### **Workout B: Long Intervals ("Steady Hard")**

**What you'll do:**

- 3–5 sets of 6–10 minute continuous climbing at challenging but sustainable intensity
- You should be able to complete each interval without falling
- Rest 4–6 minutes between intervals
- Focus on maintaining steady pace and finding recovery positions

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 3 × 6 minutes (rest 5 min)
- Week 6: 4 × 6 minutes (rest 5 min)
- Week 7: 4 × 8 minutes (rest 6 min)
- Week 8 (deload): 2 × 6 minutes (rest 6 min)

**What to track:**

- Total work time completed (e.g., 4 × 6 min = 24 min)
- Pump level after each interval
- Recovery quality between intervals (did 4–6 min feel sufficient?)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** These intervals sit in the intensity zone where aerobic metabolism contributes substantially while still accumulating fatigue. The research on finger flexor energetics shows that intermittent endurance work has high aerobic contribution—exactly what you need for sustained route climbing.

------

### **Workout C: Strength Maintenance + Technique Focus**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Max Hangs*

- Same as Mesocycle 1: 4 reps × 10s at 85–90% max
- 2-minute rest between reps

*Part 2: Technical Route Practice*

- Climb 2–3 routes specifically working on: efficient clipping, optimal rest positions, pacing strategy
- Film yourself if possible to review technique

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Consistent structure across Weeks 5–7
- Week 8 (deload): Skip max hangs, 1–2 easy technical routes only

**What to track:**

- Max hang load and finger comfort
- Technical observations (specific movement patterns to improve)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

------

### **Week 8: Deload + Testing**

**Monday:** 20-minute ARC only

**Wednesday:** Retest intermittent endurance + optional ARC benchmark if fresh

**Friday:** Light technique climbing, no testing

**What to track:**

- Test results vs. Week 4 and baseline
- Weekly sRPE totals for Weeks 5–7 (are you managing load appropriately?)
- Symptom trends (any increasing pain or stiffness patterns?)

**Expected outcomes:** Further improvements in endurance metrics. Your ARC time should be notably longer than baseline, and intervals should feel more manageable.

------

## Mesocycle 3: Specific Endurance + Route Tactics (Weeks 9–12)

The final block emphasizes route-specific skills: executing long climbs efficiently, managing fatigue, and improving tactics like pacing and rest positioning.

### **Workout A: Long Route Simulations**

**What you'll do:**

- Choose routes or create combinations that take 6–10+ minutes of sustained climbing
- Climb with full attention to: pacing, shakeout efficiency, clipping rhythm, reading ahead
- 2–3 attempts with 15–20 minute rest between

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 2 attempts at 6–8 minute routes
- Week 10: 3 attempts at 8–10 minute routes
- Week 11: 2–3 attempts at your target long route style/length
- Week 12 (taper): 1 high-quality attempt, fresh

**What to track:**

- Route length/time
- Number of shakeouts taken, quality of rests
- Where fatigue hit hardest
- Pacing observations (did you start too fast?)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** The research emphasizes that climbing performance isn't purely physiological—technique and tactics matter enormously on long routes. This workout integrates your developed aerobic capacity with real route execution.

------

### **Workout B: Moderate Volume Climbing**

**What you'll do:**

- 20–30 minutes of varied moderate climbing
- Mix different styles: vertical, overhanging, technical, sustained
- Focus on efficiency and finding rhythm in different contexts

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 25 minutes mixed climbing
- Week 10: 30 minutes mixed climbing
- Week 11: 25 minutes mixed climbing (starting to reduce volume)
- Week 12 (taper): 15 minutes easy climbing

**What to track:**

- Total time, variety of styles attempted
- Energy levels, pump onset patterns
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

------

### **Workout C: Minimal Strength Maintenance + Performance Practice**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Max Hangs (reduced volume)*

- 4 reps × 10s at 85–90% (Weeks 9–10)
- 2 reps × 10s at 85–90% (Week 11)
- Skip entirely Week 12 (taper)

*Part 2: Target Route Attempts*

- Work your actual long route goal, or the closest simulation
- Full rest between attempts (20+ minutes)
- Maximum quality, minimum junk volume

**What to track:**

- Max hang load (should remain stable)
- Route performance (progress toward sending)
- Strategic insights (what worked? what needs adjustment?)
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day recovery quality

------

### **Week 12: Taper + Performance**

**Purpose:** Minimize fatigue while maintaining fitness for peak performance attempts.

**Monday:** 15-minute easy ARC + light route practice

**Wednesday:** Rest or very light activity

**Friday:** Final performance attempt on your target long route

**Saturday/Sunday:** Additional attempts if needed, or celebration!

**What to track:**

- Final performance outcome
- How it felt compared to earlier attempts
- Overall progress through the 12 weeks

------

## Ongoing Tracking Throughout the Plan

### Weekly Summary (Complete Every Sunday)

| Metric                | How to Track                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total sRPE**        | Add up all session loads (duration × RPE) from the week      |
| **Monotony**          | Are all sessions similar intensity? Flag if yes (increases injury risk) |
| **Finger symptoms**   | Any pain, stiffness, or discomfort trends?                   |
| **Sleep quality**     | Rate 1–10 average across the week                            |
| **Energy/motivation** | Rate 1–10 (helps identify overtraining)                      |

### Red Flags (Stop and Reassess If You See These)

- Sharp pain during finger work
- Increasing finger pain/stiffness trend over 2+ weeks
- sRPE increasing week-to-week without planned progression
- Persistent fatigue or declining motivation
- Next-day pain that doesn't resolve with warm-up

**Why monitoring matters:** The research consistently emphasizes that overuse injuries are common in climbing and that load management is a modifiable risk factor. Tracking helps you catch problems before they become serious injuries.

------

## Why This Plan Works (Research Summary)

This plan is built directly from the evidence in your project document:

1. **Aerobic emphasis:** Long routes require substantial aerobic metabolism contribution in the finger flexors. ARC training and long intervals specifically develop this capacity.
2. **Strength maintenance:** Even for endurance goals, maintaining finger strength keeps holds at a lower percentage of maximum, delaying pump onset.
3. **Progressive overload:** Volume increases gradually (time, then intensity) following established resistance training principles while respecting finger tissue vulnerability.
4. **Deload weeks:** Every 4th week reduces volume to manage accumulated fatigue and injury risk—critical given climbing's overuse injury patterns.
5. **Specificity progression:** The plan moves from general endurance → volume build → route-specific skills, matching how climbing interventions are typically structured.
6. **Load monitoring:** Session-RPE tracking helps you manage total stress and catch overtraining before it causes problems.

The 3-day structure provides enough stimulus to drive adaptation while allowing adequate recovery—essential for adult climbers who often have other life stresses and higher injury risk than younger athletes.
