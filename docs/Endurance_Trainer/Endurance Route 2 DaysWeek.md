# 12-Week Training Plan for Long Endurance Route Performance (2 Days/Week)

This plan maintains the same goals and evidence-based principles as the 3-day plan, but consolidates training into 2 sessions per week. The key adaptation is combining workout elements strategically while carefully managing fatigue to prevent overuse injuries—especially important with limited training frequency.

## Pre-Training Assessment (Week 0)

The assessment is identical to the 3-day plan:

### Required Tests

1. **Finger Max Strength Test**
   - 7-second max hang on 20–22mm edge, half-crimp grip
   - Progressive warm-up, 2-minute rest between attempts
   - Record maximum load (bodyweight ± added/removed weight)
2. **Intermittent Finger Endurance Test**
   - 7 seconds on / 2 seconds off at 60% of max hang load
   - Record total repetitions to failure
3. **ARC Benchmark**
   - Continuous easy climbing at "light pump" intensity
   - Record total time and perceived pump level (1–10)
4. **Technique/Efficiency Proxy**
   - Standard circuit: record time, shakeouts, unplanned stops
   - Optional video review
5. **Injury Risk Baseline**
   - Finger pain check (especially pulleys)
   - Elbow/shoulder discomfort
   - Morning stiffness levels

## The 12-Week Program Structure

Same mesocycle framework:

- **Weeks 1–3:** Aerobic base + technique development
- **Week 4:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 5–7:** Volume build
- **Week 8:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 9–11:** Specific endurance + route tactics
- **Week 12:** Taper + performance week

------

## Weekly Schedule (2 Workouts/Week)

With only 2 sessions weekly, each workout combines multiple training elements. The research shows that mixed sessions are common in climbing, which is why session-RPE monitoring becomes even more critical for tracking total load.

### Standard Week Layout

| Day         | Activity                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Monday      | Rest                                               |
| **Tuesday** | Workout A: Primary endurance + strength            |
| Wednesday   | Rest                                               |
| Thursday    | Rest                                               |
| **Friday**  | Workout B: Volume/intervals + technique            |
| Saturday    | Optional: very easy climbing (social/fun, <30 min) |
| Sunday      | Rest                                               |

**Why Tuesday/Friday:** This spacing provides 3 days recovery after each session, allowing adequate tissue recovery given the higher per-session volume. The research emphasizes that overuse injuries relate to inadequate recovery between loading bouts.

------

## Mesocycle 1: Aerobic Base + Technique (Weeks 1–4)

### **Workout A: ARC + Strength Maintenance**

This combines aerobic development with finger strength work, keeping them in one session because both are relatively low-fatigue compared to high-intensity intervals.

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: ARC-Style Continuous Climbing (20–30 minutes)*

- Easy terrain, conversational intensity, light pump only
- Smooth, efficient movement focus
- Can break into 2 sets if needed: 15 min + rest 3 min + 10 min

*Part 2: Max Hangs (after 10-minute rest)*

- 4 repetitions × 10 seconds at 85–90% of your max
- 20–22mm edge, half-crimp grip
- 2 minutes rest between reps
- Stop immediately if any finger pain

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 20 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 2: 25 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 3: 30 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 4 (deload): 15 min ARC, skip hangs

**What to track after each session:**

- ARC time and pump level (1–10)
- Max hang load and finger comfort (0–10 pain scale)
- Total session duration
- Session RPE (0–10, rated 30 min after finishing)
- Calculate sRPE: Duration × RPE
- Next-day symptoms (finger stiffness, soreness)

**Why this structure works:** ARC work is low-intensity, so you can perform max hangs afterward when you're still relatively fresh but have accumulated some time-on-wall. The research shows both aerobic capacity and maximal strength matter for endurance climbing—this hits both efficiently.

------

### **Workout B: Moderate Laps + Route Practice**

This session builds moderate-intensity endurance while developing route-specific skills.

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Continuous Moderate Laps (30–40 minutes total)*

- 3–5 laps on moderate circuit (10–15 moves per lap)
- Difficulty: manageable but accumulating pump
- Rest 3–5 minutes between laps
- Focus: efficient movement, shakeout positions, breathing rhythm

*Part 2: Technical Route Mileage (15–20 minutes)*

- 2–3 routes at comfortable level
- Emphasis: reading sequences, identifying rests, efficient clipping
- Quality over quantity

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 1: 3 laps + 2 routes
- Week 2: 4 laps + 2 routes
- Week 3: 5 laps + 3 routes
- Week 4 (deload): 2 laps + 1 easy route

**What to track:**

- Number of laps completed
- Pump level progression across laps
- Routes climbed (notes on efficiency, pacing)
- Total session duration
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Movement quality observations (overgripping? rushed? smooth?)
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** This session focuses on time-on-wall at moderate intensity, which the research identifies as crucial for developing forearm aerobic capacity. The route practice afterward integrates technical skills while you're somewhat fatigued—simulating real long-route conditions.

------

### **Week 4: Deload + Testing**

**Tuesday (Workout A):** 15-minute ARC only (no hangs)

**Friday:** Testing day

- Retest intermittent finger endurance (7s on/2s off at 60% MVC)
- Retest ARC benchmark
- Light technique climbing if time/energy permits

**What to track:**

- Test results vs. baseline
- Perceived effort during tests
- Overall fatigue through the week
- Any developing symptoms

**Expected outcomes:** Improvements in endurance metrics (more reps, longer ARC time). The deload allows supercompensation before the next block.

------

## Mesocycle 2: Volume Build (Weeks 5–8)

This block increases total climbing volume and introduces longer sustained efforts.

### **Workout A: Extended ARC + Strength Maintenance**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Extended ARC (35–50 minutes)*

- Continuous easy climbing, light pump only
- Can split: 25 min + 5 min rest + 15–20 min if needed
- Very low intensity maintained throughout

*Part 2: Max Hangs (after 10-minute rest)*

- Same structure: 4 reps × 10s at 85–90% max
- 2-minute rest between reps

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 35 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 6: 40 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 7: 45–50 min ARC + 4 hangs
- Week 8 (deload): 20 min ARC, skip hangs

**What to track:**

- ARC time and pump level
- Max hang load and finger comfort
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Efficiency observations (getting smoother at longer durations?)
- Next-day symptoms
- Weekly sRPE total (add both sessions each week)

------

### **Workout B: Long Intervals + Route Work**

This is the higher-intensity session of the week, building sustained work capacity.

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Long Intervals (30–40 minutes total work)*

- 3–5 sets × 6–10 minutes continuous climbing at challenging-but-sustainable intensity
- Should complete without falling
- Rest 4–6 minutes between intervals
- Focus: steady pace, finding recovery positions mid-interval

*Part 2: Technical Route Practice (15 minutes)*

- 1–2 routes focusing on efficiency and pacing
- Practice specific skills: rest identification, clipping rhythm, reading ahead

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 5: 3 × 6 min (rest 5 min) + 2 routes
- Week 6: 4 × 6 min (rest 5 min) + 2 routes
- Week 7: 4 × 8 min (rest 6 min) + 1 route
- Week 8 (deload): 2 × 6 min (rest 6 min) + 1 easy route

**What to track:**

- Total interval work time
- Pump level after each interval
- Recovery quality between intervals
- Route performance notes
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

**Why this works:** These longer intervals develop the specific aerobic contribution the research identifies as crucial for sustained climbing. The 4–6 minute rest allows partial recovery, similar to the intermittent nature of real route climbing with shakeouts and rests.

------

### **Week 8: Deload + Testing**

**Tuesday:** 20-minute ARC only

**Friday:** Testing day

- Retest intermittent endurance
- Retest ARC benchmark if fresh
- Very light climbing if energy permits

**What to track:**

- Test results vs. Week 4 and baseline
- Weekly sRPE totals for Weeks 5–7
- Symptom trends

**Expected outcomes:** Further endurance improvements. Your sustained work capacity should be noticeably better.

------

## Mesocycle 3: Specific Endurance + Route Tactics (Weeks 9–12)

The final block emphasizes route-specific execution and performance.

### **Workout A: Route Simulations + Minimal Strength**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Long Route Simulations (main focus)*

- 2–3 attempts at routes/combinations taking 6–10+ minutes
- Full attention to: pacing, shakeouts, clipping, reading ahead
- 15–20 minute rest between attempts
- This is your primary performance-building work

*Part 2: Minimal Strength Maintenance (after long rest)*

- Weeks 9–10: 4 reps × 10s at 85–90%
- Week 11: 2 reps × 10s at 85–90%
- Week 12: skip entirely

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 2 attempts (6–8 min routes) + 4 hangs
- Week 10: 3 attempts (8–10 min routes) + 4 hangs
- Week 11: 2–3 attempts (target length) + 2 hangs
- Week 12 (taper): 1 fresh attempt, no hangs

**What to track:**

- Route length/time
- Shakeout quality and frequency
- Where fatigue hit hardest
- Pacing observations
- Max hang load (maintenance check)
- Session duration and RPE/sRPE
- Next-day recovery quality

**Why this works:** This session prioritizes route-specific skills while maintaining just enough strength work to prevent detraining. The research emphasizes that technique and tactics are crucial for long-route performance—this integrates them with your developed aerobic capacity.

------

### **Workout B: Mixed Volume Climbing**

**What you'll do:**

*Part 1: Moderate Volume (25–35 minutes)*

- Varied moderate climbing: vertical, overhanging, technical
- Mix different movement styles and intensities
- Focus on efficiency across different contexts

*Part 2: Specific Tactic Practice (15–20 minutes)*

- Work on identified weaknesses from Workout A
- Examples: rest position practice, efficient clipping drills, pacing control
- Light, focused work

**Week-by-week progression:**

- Week 9: 30 min mixed + tactic practice
- Week 10: 35 min mixed + tactic practice
- Week 11: 25 min mixed + tactic practice (reducing volume)
- Week 12 (taper): 15 min easy climbing only

**What to track:**

- Total time and variety attempted
- Energy levels and pump patterns
- Specific skill improvements
- Session RPE/sRPE
- Next-day symptoms

------

### **Week 12: Taper + Performance**

**Tuesday:** 15-minute easy ARC + very light route practice

**Friday:** Final performance attempt on your target long route

- Full rest, maximum quality
- Apply all learned tactics

**Weekend:** Additional attempts if needed, or celebrate success!

**What to track:**

- Final performance outcome
- Felt difficulty vs. earlier attempts
- Overall 12-week progress summary

------

## Key Differences from 3-Day Plan

### Volume Management

**Total weekly volume is necessarily lower with 2 sessions:**

- 3-day plan might accumulate 150–200 minutes/week at peak
- 2-day plan peaks around 100–140 minutes/week
- This is compensated by slightly longer individual sessions

**Why this still works:** The research shows that adaptation occurs with appropriate stimulus, not just maximal volume. Quality matters more than quantity, and 2 focused sessions can drive meaningful endurance improvements while reducing overuse risk.

### Session Structure

**Combined elements require careful sequencing:**

1. Lower-intensity work (ARC) comes first when fresh
2. Higher-intensity work (intervals, route simulations) is protected as main session focus
3. Strength work comes last (when it's maintenance) or after adequate rest
4. Each session has clear primary goal to prevent trying to do everything

### Recovery Emphasis

**With 2 days/week, recovery becomes even more critical:**

- 3+ days between sessions allows full tissue recovery
- More sensitive to session-RPE spikes (less tolerance for "junk volume")
- Injury risk actually may be lower due to more recovery time
- BUT: must maintain discipline on rest days (no "light gym sessions" that add hidden load)

### Progression Constraints

**Progress is slower but sustainable:**

- Expect 60–80% of the gains you'd see with 3-day plan
- Timeline to peak performance may extend 4–6 weeks longer
- Trade-off: lower injury risk, better work-life balance, sustainable long-term

## Ongoing Tracking Throughout the Plan

### Weekly Summary (Complete Every Sunday)

| Metric                | How to Track                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total sRPE**        | Add both session loads (duration × RPE) from the week |
| **Session balance**   | Are sessions similar RPE, or is one much harder?      |
| **Finger symptoms**   | Any pain, stiffness, discomfort trends?               |
| **Recovery quality**  | Do you feel fresh before each session? (Rate 1–10)    |
| **Sleep quality**     | Average across week (1–10)                            |
| **Energy/motivation** | Rate 1–10                                             |

### Red Flags (Stop and Reassess)

**Same as 3-day plan:**

- Sharp pain during finger work
- Increasing finger pain/stiffness trend over 2+ weeks
- Persistent fatigue despite adequate rest days
- Next-day pain that doesn't resolve with warm-up
- Declining motivation or performance

**Additional 2-day specific flags:**

- Sessions consistently feeling overwhelming (may need to reduce per-session volume)
- Not recovering fully within 3 days between sessions
- Wanting to add extra climbing on rest days (sign you may need better session quality, not more volume)

## Sample Session Tracking Template

Since sessions are longer and combine multiple elements, detailed tracking is important:

### Combined Session Log

| Date | Mesocycle | Workout | Element 1            | Element 2               | Element 3 | Total Duration | Session RPE | sRPE | Next-day notes            |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------------------- |
| 2/18 | M1W1      | A       | ARC 20min, pump 3/10 | Max hangs 4×10s @ +10kg | -         | 45 min         | 6           | 270  | Fingers slightly stiff AM |
| 2/21 | M1W1      | B       | 3 laps, pump 5→7/10  | 2 routes (5.10a, 5.10b) | -         | 55 min         | 7           | 385  | Felt good, no issues      |

------

## Why This 2-Day Plan Works (Research Summary)

This plan maintains the evidence-based principles while adapting for limited frequency:

1. **Aerobic emphasis preserved:** ARC and interval work still target forearm aerobic capacity, just consolidated into fewer sessions
2. **Strength maintenance included:** Minimal-dose max hangs (4 reps, 1×/week) maintain finger strength ceiling without excessive fatigue accumulation
3. **Progressive overload applied:** Volume increases gradually within each session and across mesocycles, respecting tissue adaptation rates
4. **Deload weeks maintained:** Every 4th week still reduces volume—critical for injury prevention given the research on overuse patterns
5. **Specificity progression:** Still moves from general endurance → volume → route-specific skills, just with longer per-session exposure
6. **Recovery prioritized:** 3+ days between sessions and careful load monitoring reduce overuse injury risk—potentially lower than 3-day plan if session quality is maintained
7. **Session-RPE monitoring:** Even more critical with combined sessions to ensure total load stays appropriate

**The key insight:** The research shows climbing performance improves with specific, progressive training. While 3 days/week allows more volume and variety, 2 days/week can still drive meaningful adaptation if sessions are well-designed and recovery is respected. The lower frequency may actually be more sustainable long-term for many adult climbers balancing other life commitments.

## Comparison: Expected Outcomes vs. 3-Day Plan

| Metric                                 | 3-Day Plan (12 weeks) | 2-Day Plan (12 weeks)    | Notes                              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Intermittent endurance improvement** | +30–50% reps          | +20–40% reps             | Both meaningful; 2-day just slower |
| **ARC time improvement**               | +40–70% time          | +30–50% time             | Aerobic gains still substantial    |
| **Max hang maintenance**               | Likely +5–10%         | Stable or +0–5%          | Maintenance vs. building           |
| **Route-specific skills**              | High transfer         | Moderate-high transfer   | Slightly less practice volume      |
| **Injury risk**                        | Low (with monitoring) | Very low (more recovery) | Trade-off favors 2-day             |
| **Time to peak performance**           | 12–16 weeks           | 16–20 weeks              | Need patience with 2-day           |

**Bottom line:** If you have life constraints requiring 2 days/week, this plan will still produce meaningful endurance improvements. It just requires patience, discipline on rest days, and acceptance that progress comes more gradually.
