# **Bouldering 2 day/week Plan**

## Pre-Training Assessment (Week 0)

Complete the same baseline tests:

**Primary Tests:**

1. **7-second max hang** (20mm edge, half-crimp)
2. **Campus board assessment** (optional - skip if injury risk)
3. **Limit boulder benchmark** (3-5 problems at your limit)
4. **Injury screening** (finger pain, stiffness, shoulder/elbow check)

## 12-Week Training Structure

Sessions are numbered **1–24** in order (e.g., Session 1 = Week 1 first session, Session 2 = Week 1 second session, …, Session 24 = Week 12 second session).

With only 2 sessions/week, we'll combine elements that were separated in the 3-day plan:

- **Weeks 1-3:** Max strength foundation
- **Week 4:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 5-7:** Power/RFD block
- **Week 8:** Deload + retest
- **Weeks 9-11:** Performance peak
- **Week 12:** Taper + performance week

## MESOCYCLE 1: Max Strength Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-3 Training Schedule (2x/week)

### Week 1-3 Progression Rules

**For max hangs:**

- If you complete all 6 sets × 10s with perfect form for 2 consecutive Tuesdays → add 2-3% load
- If you fail before set 6 → stay at same weight
- Never progress if finger pain >2/10

**For limit bouldering:**

- Week 1: Establish your limit (what you can do in 3-5 attempts)
- Week 2: Attempt slightly harder versions or smaller holds
- Week 3: Consolidate - improve efficiency on Week 1-2 problems
- Don't just chase volume - aim for 13-17 total limit problems across both sessions

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Session A (Tuesday) — Session 7:**

- Max hang retest (same protocol as Week 0)
- Easy climbing: 20-30 min at comfortable intensity
- Light antagonists: 2 sets each

**Session B (Friday) — Session 8:**

### Week 5-7 Training Schedule

**SESSION A (Tuesday) — Sessions 9, 11, 13: Campus Board + Max Hang Maintenance + Power Bouldering**

*What to do:*

- **Extended warm-up:** 20 min progressive climbing + easy campus moves

- **Campus board work** (pick 2 exercises, rotate each week):

  *Rotation A:*

  - 1-4-7-10 ladder: 4 sets, match top rung, 3 min rest
  - Max reach ladder: 4 sets, controlled catches, 3 min rest

  *Rotation B:*

  - "1-2-3" style reaches: 4 sets at ~75% max reach, 3 min rest
  - "10RM" continuous: 4 sets to near-failure at move 10, 3 min rest

- **Max hang maintenance:** 4 sets × 10s at 85-90%

  - Reduced volume from Mesocycle 1, but maintain intensity
  - 2 min rest

- **Dynamic/powerful boulders:** 4-5 problems

  - Emphasis on explosive moves, dynos, powerful sequences
  - 3-4 attempts each
  - 5 min rest between problems

*Track:*

- Campus exercises completed
- Highest rung reached (for max reach exercises)
- Form quality across sets (good/declining)
- Max hang load maintained (yes/no)
- Power boulder attempts/sends
- sRPE
- **CRITICAL:** Any finger, shoulder, or elbow pain (0-10)

**SESSION B (Friday) — Sessions 10, 12, 14: Limit Bouldering (Coordination + Technique) + Strength**

*What to do:*

- **Warm-up:** 15-20 min progressive
- **Coordination/technical limit bouldering:** 7-9 problems
  - Complex sequences, precise footwork
  - Mix of styles - avoid only campus-style power
  - Include vertical technical, compression, balance problems
  - 3-5 attempts each, 4-5 min rest
- **Weighted pull-ups:** 4 sets × 3-5 reps
  - 3 min rest
- **Core circuit:** 3 sets
  - Front lever progressions or tuck holds: 3-5 reps
  - Hanging knee raises: 10-12 reps
  - Side planks: 30-40s each

*Track:*

- Problems attempted/sent by style
- Movement quality evolution
- Pull-up weight maintained or increased
- Cumulative fatigue from Tuesday
- sRPE
- Recovery indicators

### Week 5-7 Progression

**Campus work:**

- Week 5: Establish baseline with deeper rungs (25mm if available)
- Week 6: Maintain exercises, focus on quality
- Week 7: Progress to smaller rungs (20mm) OR increase sets ONLY if pain-free

**Limit bouldering:**

- Shift difficulty from pure strength to power + coordination
- Reduce total attempts per problem (aim for efficiency: send in 2-3 tries)

**Critical safety note:** Campus board is high-stress. If any finger/shoulder pain >1/10, skip campus and do explosive bouldering instead.

### Week 8: Deload + Retest

**Session A (Tuesday) — Session 15:**

- Campus max reach test (if you've been campus training)

## Weekly Monitoring Template (2-Day Version)

Track these metrics:

| Day                     | Tue AM | Wed AM | Fri AM | Sat AM | Sun AM |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Finger stiffness (0-10) |        |        |        |        |        |
| Finger pain (0-10)      |        |        |        |        |        |
| Energy level (1-5)      |        |        |        |        |        |
| Sleep quality (1-5)     |        |        |        |        |        |
| Motivation (1-5)        |        |        |        |        |        |

**Weekly summary:**

- Total sRPE for week: _____ (Tuesday + Friday)
- Session A sRPE: _____
- Session B sRPE: _____
- Any pain episodes: _____
- Weekly climbing minutes: _____
- Skin recovery: Good / Fair / Poor

**Weekly load management:**

- If week-to-week sRPE increases >20% without performance improvement → reduce volume next week
- If finger stiffness trends upward for 2+ weeks → insert extra rest day

------

## Key Differences from 3-Day Plan

**What's combined:**

- Max hangs + limit bouldering happen same session (Tuesday in Mesocycle 1)
- Pulling strength integrated into Session A
- More problems per session (since you only have 2 sessions)

**What's prioritized:**

- Finger strength work on Session A (freshest day)
- Higher total bouldering volume per session
- Recovery between sessions is critical (3-4 days between)

**What's reduced:**

- Total weekly volume (accept this - quality matters more)
- Auxiliary work volume (lighter antagonist loads)
- Campus board sets (4 sets instead of 8+ weekly in 3-day plan)

**What's emphasized MORE:**

- Movement quality and efficiency per attempt
- Recovery monitoring (you have less margin for error)
- Deload compliance (non-negotiable with only 2 sessions)

------

## Critical Safety Reminders (Even More Important on 2 Days/Week)

**STOP IMMEDIATELY if:**

- Sharp "pop" sensation in finger
- Pain >3/10 during finger loading
- Rapid swelling in any finger joint
- Pain that worsens during session

**You have LESS recovery opportunity with 2 days/week, so:**

- Never skip warm-ups (minimum 15 min, preferably 20 min)
- Never train through finger pain >2/10
- Deload weeks are mandatory (Week 4, Week 8)
- If you feel under-recovered on Friday, reduce volume by 30-40% that session

**Wednesday optional climbing:**

- Only if you feel fully recovered
- Keep it genuinely easy (3-4 grades below max)
- Consider it "active rest" not training
- Skip it if Tuesday was particularly hard

------

## Realistic Expectations for 2 Days/Week

**You CAN expect:**

- Meaningful finger strength gains (+5-15% max hang)
- Improved movement efficiency and power
- Grade improvements over 12 weeks
- Better send rate (fewer attempts needed)

**You should NOT expect:**

- Same total volume as someone training 4-5 days/week
- To match progress of 3-day/week plan exactly
- To recover from maximum volume every session

**The advantage:**

- Lower injury risk with more recovery time
- Each session is higher quality (more focused)
- Easier to maintain consistency long-term
- Less cumulative fatigue

------

This 2-day plan concentrates the essential elements from the research: max strength development, power/RFD work, and performance specificity, while respecting your time constraints and recovery capacity. Quality of sessions matters far more than total weekly volume.
