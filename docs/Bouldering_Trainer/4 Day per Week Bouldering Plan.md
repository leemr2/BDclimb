**For pulling strength:**

- Add weight when you can complete all 5 sets × 5 reps with good form
- Typical progression: 2-5 lbs per week

**Weekly volume targets:**

- Total limit problems across all sessions: 16-20 problems

## Critical Safety & Load Management

### STOP Training Immediately If:

**Red flags (require medical evaluation):**

- Sharp "pop" sensation in finger
- Rapid swelling in finger joint
- Sharp pain that doesn't resolve with rest
- Numbness or tingling in fingers

**Yellow flags (modify training):**

- Pain >3/10 during finger loading
- Pain that worsens during session
- Morning stiffness >6/10 for 2+ consecutive days
- Skin splits that won't heal

### Weekly Load Management Rules

**Rule 1: sRPE progression**

- Week-to-week increase should be <15%
- If sRPE jumps >20% without clear reason → reduce next week's volume
- Example: Week 2 total sRPE = 1200, Week 3 should be <1380

**Rule 2: Deload compliance**

- Weeks 4 and 8 are mandatory deloads (40-50% volume reduction)
- Cannot be skipped or moved
- Keep some intensity, reduce volume

**Rule 3: Finger pain threshold**

- Any finger pain >2/10: reduce that session's intensity
- Finger pain >3/10: stop finger loading entirely that session
- Finger pain persisting >2 days: take extra rest day

**Rule 4: Recovery monitoring**

- If "recovery from last session" is <3/5 for two consecutive training days → insert extra rest day
- If weekly average energy <3/5 for 2 consecutive weeks → reduce volume 20-30%

### Session-Specific Safety

**Max hangs:**

- Always use 15-20 min warm-up minimum
- Never progress load AND volume in same week
- Stop set immediately if scapular position breaks
- 2% load increases maximum (for fingers, smaller is better)

**Campus board:**

- Only during Weeks 5-7 (4-week block maximum)
- Extended warm-up required (20+ min)
- Skip entirely if finger/shoulder pain >1/10
- Controlled catches only - no slamming into rungs
- Avoid full crimp grip positions
- If form degrades across sets → stop that exercise

**Limit bouldering:**

- Stop attempting a problem after 5 tries (unless it's a project session)
- Rest 4-5 min minimum between attempts (8-12 min for projects)
- Never boulder through finger pain >2/10
- Skin management: stop if bleeding or deep splits

### Warm-up Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

**Minimum warm-up structure:**

1. Easy climbing: 10-15 min (gradually increasing difficulty)
2. Specific prep: 5-10 min
   - For max hangs: progressive hang protocol (BW → 50% → 75% → 90% of work load)
   - For campus: easy campus ladders at low intensity
   - For limit bouldering: moderate problems in similar style
3. Movement prep: 5 min (arm circles, scapular activation, finger flexion/extension)

**Total minimum: 20 min for high-intensity sessions, 15 min for moderate sessions**

### Taping Philosophy

The research indicates taping has limited evidence for injury prevention in uninjured climbers. Therefore:

**Do NOT use taping as:**

- Primary injury prevention
- Substitute for proper warm-up
- Way to train through pain
- Reason to avoid deloads or load management

**Taping MAY be used for:**

- Skin protection (splits/cracks)
- Return from injury (with professional guidance)
- Specific loading support (under PT supervision)

**Bottom line:** If you feel you "need" tape to train, that's a signal to reduce load, not add tape.

## 4-Day Plan Advantages & Considerations

### Why 4 Days Works Well for Bouldering

**Optimal stimulus separation:**

- Two max hang sessions (Mon/Thu) with 3 days between
- Campus work (Mon) gets 6 days recovery before next
- Limit bouldering spread across 3 sessions with different styles
- Enough rest days (3 per week) for tissue recovery

**Better quality per session:**

- Each session has clearer focus than 3-day plan
- Less need to combine conflicting stimuli
- More total weekly volume than 2-day, but manageable intensity per day

**Injury risk management:**

- Every high-intensity day followed by rest or low-intensity
- Tuesday active recovery helps process Monday's load
- Three distinct rest days allow tissue adaptation

### Compared to Other Frequencies

**vs. 2-day plan:**

- ~50% more weekly volume possible
- Better separation of max strength and power work
- More opportunities for limit bouldering attempts
- Higher total training stimulus

**vs. 3-day plan:**

- One additional focused session
- Better recovery between max hang days (Mon/Thu vs. Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Dedicated active recovery day (Tuesday)
- Cleaner periodization structure

**vs. 5-6 day plan:**

- Lower injury risk (more rest days)
- Higher quality per session (more recovery)
- More sustainable long-term
- Easier to maintain other life commitments

### Realistic Expectations (4 Days/Week, 12 Weeks)

**You CAN expect:**

- Max hang improvement: +8-15% (e.g., +5-12 kg on 7s hang)
- Grade improvement: 1-2 V-grades on limit bouldering
- Pull-up strength: +10-25 lbs
- Campus metrics: +1-3 rungs max reach, +5-15 moves to failure
- Efficiency: 30-50% reduction in attempts-to-send on benchmarks
- Movement quality: noticeable improvements in power, coordination, technique

**You should NOT expect:**

- Linear weekly improvements (adaptations come in waves)
- Zero setbacks or plateaus (some weeks will feel harder)
- To match elite progression rates (those athletes have years of base)
- Perfect adherence (life happens - 85-90% compliance is excellent)

**Critical success factors:**

- Deload compliance (Weeks 4, 8 are non-negotiable)
- Load monitoring (track sRPE and adjust)
- Injury prevention (stop criteria respected)
- Sleep and nutrition (can't train around poor recovery)
- Patience (meaningful adaptations take 4-8 weeks to manifest)

## Sample Week Visualization

Here's what a typical week looks like in each mesocycle:

**Mesocycle 1 (Max Strength) - Week 2:**

- **Monday:** Max hangs (90 min) → sRPE ~630 (70 min × 9 RPE)
- **Tuesday:** Easy climbing + antagonists (75 min) → sRPE ~300 (75 min × 4 RPE)
- **Wednesday:** REST
- **Thursday:** Max hangs + bouldering (85 min) → sRPE ~680 (85 min × 8 RPE)
- **Friday:** REST
- **Saturday:** Pull-ups + bouldering (95 min) → sRPE ~760 (95 min × 8 RPE)
- **Sunday:** REST
- **Weekly total sRPE:** ~2,370

**Mesocycle 2 (Power/RFD) - Week 6:**

- **Monday:** Campus + power bouldering (100 min) → sRPE ~900 (100 min × 9 RPE)
- **Tuesday:** Easy climbing + mobility (70 min) → sRPE ~280 (70 min × 4 RPE)
- **Wednesday:** REST
- **Thursday:** Max hangs + coordination (75 min) → sRPE ~525 (75 min × 7 RPE)
- **Friday:** REST
- **Saturday:** Pull-ups + bouldering (90 min) → sRPE ~720 (90 min × 8 RPE)
- **Sunday:** REST
- **Weekly total sRPE:** ~2,425

**Mesocycle 3 (Performance) - Week 10:**

- **Monday:** Projects + hangs (80 min) → sRPE ~640 (80 min × 8 RPE)
- **Tuesday:** Movement quality (65 min) → sRPE ~260 (65 min × 4 RPE)
- **Wednesday:** REST
- **Thursday:** Performance attempts (75 min) → sRPE ~600 (75 min × 8 RPE)
- **Friday:** REST
- **Saturday:** Mixed volume (85 min) → sRPE ~510 (85 min × 6 RPE)
- **Sunday:** REST
- **Weekly total sRPE:** ~2,010 (reduced from Meso 2)

This 4-day plan provides the optimal balance of training stimulus, recovery, and specificity for meaningful bouldering performance gains while managing injury risk through strategic rest and load monitoring.
