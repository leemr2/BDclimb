# **Bouldering 3 Day/week Plan** 

## Pre-Training Assessment (Week 0)

Before starting, complete these baseline tests:

**Primary Tests:**

1. **7-second max hang** (20mm edge, half-crimp grip)
   - Warm up thoroughly with easy climbing + progressive hangs
   - Add weight progressively until you find your max 7-second hold
   - Rest 2 minutes between attempts
   - Record: Total load (bodyweight + added weight)
2. **Campus board assessment** (if available and safe)
   - Max reach test: Highest rung you can reach and control
   - Moves to failure: Continuous ladder moves until exhaustion
   - Record: Highest rung number, total moves completed
3. **Limit boulder benchmark**
   - Pick 3-5 problems at your current limit (1-3 attempts to complete)
   - Record: Grades, number of attempts, quality notes
4. **Injury screening**
   - Finger pain check (0-10 scale for each finger)
   - Morning stiffness assessment
   - Any shoulder/elbow discomfort

- **Limit bouldering:** 4-6 problems at your current limit
  - 3-5 high-quality attempts per problem
  - Rest 4-5 minutes between attempts
  - Focus on problems requiring maximum finger strength

*Track after session:*

- Max hang load used (kg)
- Number of sets completed with good form (target: 6/6)
- Limit problems attempted/sent
- Session Rating of Perceived Exertion - RPE (0-10 scale)

  - Add weight to reach failure at 3-5 reps
  - Rest 3 minutes between sets
- **Limit bouldering (style variation):**
  - If Monday was steep/powerful: do vertical/technical
  - If Monday was crimpy: do compression/pinches
  - 4-6 problems, 3-5 attempts each
  - Same rest protocol (4-5 min)

*Track after session:*

- Pull-up weight + reps completed
- Limit problems attempted/sent
- Session RPE & duration → sRPE

### Week 1-3 Progression Rules

**For max hangs:**

- If you complete all 6 sets × 10s with strict form for 2 consecutive sessions → add 2-3% load
- If you fail a set early → stay at same weight
- Never add weight if you have finger pain >2/10

**For limit bouldering:**

- Don't chase volume - quality over quantity
- Progress by attempting slightly harder problems (smaller holds, steeper angle)
- 12-18 total attempts per session is enough

### Week 4: Deload + Retest

**Monday:** Max hang retest (same protocol as Week 0) **Wednesday:** Easy climbing only (30 min), mobility work **Friday:** Limit boulder benchmark retest (same 3-5 problems from Week 0)

*Track:*

| Metric                  | Mon AM | Wed AM | Fri AM | Weekend |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Finger stiffness (0-10) |        |        |        |         |
| Finger pain (0-10)      |        |        |        |         |
| Energy level (1-5)      |        |        |        |         |
| Sleep quality (1-5)     |        |        |        |         |
| Motivation (1-5)        |        |        |        |         |

**Weekly summary:**

- Total sRPE for week: _____
- Highest sRPE session: _____
- Any pain episodes: _____
- Weekly volume (total minutes): _____

------

## Critical Safety Reminders

**STOP IMMEDIATELY if:**

- Sharp "pop" sensation in finger
- Pain >3/10 during finger loading
- Rapid swelling in any finger joint
- Pain that worsens during session

**Modify training if:**

- Morning stiffness increasing week-to-week
- Next-day finger pain consistently >2/10
- Skin not recovering between sessions
- sRPE trend climbing without performance improvement

**Remember:** The research emphasizes that overuse injuries (especially finger pulleys) are common in climbing. Conservative progression and deload weeks are not optional - they're injury prevention.

This plan gives you concrete sessions, tracking methods, and progression rules based directly on the research protocols in your document. The 3-session structure keeps intensity manageable while hitting all key adaptations: max strength → power/RFD → performance specificity.
