# Documentation Standards

## Design and product docs
- **Design documents** live in **`docs/`**, organized by feature (e.g. `docs/Bouldering_Trainer/`, `docs/PowerRoute_Trainer/`).
- When adding a new feature described in a design doc, follow the doc’s data model, flows, and naming; update the doc if the implementation diverges intentionally.

## Code comments
- Comment **why**, not **what**: explain non-obvious decisions, constraints, or business rules.
- Document public functions and exported types with a short JSDoc when the purpose isn’t clear from the name.
- For complex algorithms (e.g. safety rules, progression logic), add a brief comment or reference to the design doc section.

## README and CLAUDE.md
- **README.md**: project setup, env vars, how to run and build; keep it accurate when changing tooling or structure.
- **CLAUDE.md**: high-level architecture, stack, and conventions for AI/developers; update when adding major areas (e.g. Training Center, new Firebase usage).

## When to update docs
- New Firestore collections or security rules → update `firestore.rules` and any doc that describes the data model.
- New routes or major UI flows → update README or the relevant design doc.
- New environment variables → document in README and in `src/lib/envs/` (client/server) as applicable.
