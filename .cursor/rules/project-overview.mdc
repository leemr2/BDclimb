# Project Overview

**bdclimb** is a climbing-gym app: community scheduling + chat today; **Training Center** (four 12-week goal-based programs) is the growth direction.

## Stack
- **Next.js 14+** App Router, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Firebase** (Auth + Firestore)
- No traditional API routes; all backend via Firebase.
- Path alias: **`@/*`** → `./src/*` (use for all imports under `src/`).

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — builds `auth-service-worker.js` with esbuild, then `next build`
- `npm run lint` — ESLint

## Where the Project Is Going
- **Training Center** at `/training-center`: goal selection (bouldering, route endurance, route power, route power/endurance), then 12-week guided programs.
- Bouldering module first: step-by-step workouts, assessments, sRPE/load calculations, safety flags, education at milestones, progress charts.
- New code lives under: `src/app/training-center/`, `src/components/training/`, `src/lib/plans/`, `src/lib/firebase/training/`, `src/lib/calculations/`, `src/content/training/`.
- Integrate with **existing** auth (`useAuth()`), Firestore client, and Tailwind; do not duplicate auth or profile systems.

## Reference
- High-level architecture: **CLAUDE.md**
- Training design: **docs/Bouldering_Trainer/Bouldering_trainer_design.md** (and other docs in `docs/`).
